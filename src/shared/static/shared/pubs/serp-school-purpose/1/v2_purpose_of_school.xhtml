  going to school? </figcaption></figure> <p>Why do we go to school? Some
  people think the primary goal of education is giving knowledge to students.
  They feel there is specific information that all kids should know. For
  instance, they want kids to know what happened in the Revolutionary War and
  how the food chain works. Others interpret the main role of school as one of
  preparing students to earn a living. They are most concerned about students
  learning particular skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>
  <p>Some argue that schools should introduce a set of shared values,
  including liberty and justice. They believe this will help students
  understand the structure of our democratic government. For example, they
  feel it is important for students to understand that while each of the three
  branches of government has a different function, the three work together to
  make sure we all enjoy certain freedoms and live by the same rules.</p>
  <p>Some think schools should teach students to critically analyze what they
  see, hear, and read. They want students to be able to think carefully about
  different perspectives, to respect and challenge other viewpoints, and to
  form their own opinions about issues that affect them. Although many people
  say that they want kids to be able to think for themselves, students do not
  always have the freedom to do so in the classroom.</p> <p>What do you think
  the function of school is? What do you consider the most important factors
  in providing a good education? Which ingredients are essential in your
  recipe for a good school?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i>
