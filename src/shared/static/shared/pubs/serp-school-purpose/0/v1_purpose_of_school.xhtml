  going to school? </figcaption></figure> <p>Why do we go to school? Some
  people think the main goal of education is to give knowledge to students.
  They feel there is definite information that kids should know. For example,
  they want kids to know what happened in the Revolutionary War. They want
  them to know how the food chain works. Others interpret the role of school
  as one of getting kids ready to get a good job. They are most worried about
  students learning particular skills. They think reading, writing, and
  arithmetic are very important for kids to learn.</p> <p>Some argue that
  schools should introduce a set of shared values, including liberty and
  justice. They believe this will help students understand the structure of
  our government. They feel it is important for students to understand that
  each branch of government has a different function. They also want them to
  know that the three branches work together. Government works to make sure we
  all enjoy certain freedoms and live by the same rules.</p> <p>Some think
  schools should teach students to carefully analyze what they see, hear, and
  read. They want students to be able to think carefully about different
  perspectives. They want students to respect and challenge other viewpoints.
  They want them to form their own opinions about issues that affect them.
  Although many people say that they want kids to be able to think for
  themselves, students do not always have the freedom to do so in the
  classroom.</p> <p>What do you think is the function of school? What do you
  consider the most important factors in a good education? Which ingredients
  are key in your recipe for a good school?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
