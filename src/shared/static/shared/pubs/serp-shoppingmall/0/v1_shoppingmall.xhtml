  <body><h1>Should Shopping Malls Be Allowed To Institute Teen Curfews?</h1>
  <p>Gina and her friends just lost their social life. Their local mall
  instituted a 6:00 p.m. curfew for anyone under 16 years old. Before the new
  curfew, their parents used to drop Gina and her friends off at the mall
  every Friday night. They met up with classmates and hung out. Now, the teens
  have to bring an adult. Forty-six of 1,200 U.S. malls have instituted
  parental-escort policies. More malls are likely to do the same. They want to
  invoke parental responsibility to watch teen behavior in malls.</p> <aside>
  <h3 class="article-sidebar-title">Curfew Laws</h3> <p>State and local
  governments usually decide curfew law in the United States. Those laws risk
  being overruled if they go against Constitutional rights. Governments design
  these laws to keep order and prevent inappropriate behavior. Sometimes the
  military uses curfews to encourage young soldiers to follow good
  behaviors.</p> </aside> <p>Malls are a common place for teens to hang out
  after school. Teens like being in the malls. Malls provide a fun place to
  get together with friends from school. They are a good place to meet
  students from neighboring schools. Many believe the mall is a safe and
  well-monitored environment for young people. Most malls value teens as
  consumers. Store owners know teens have buying power. One recent study found
  that on a typical visit, 68% of teens spent two or more hours in the mall.
  More than half of teens surveyed spent $50 or more during their last visit.
  Also, mall managers realize that teens are their future adult customers.
  They do not want to discourage teens from coming to the mall.</p>

  business by hanging out at malls?</figcaption></figure> <p>However, malls
  were not designed to be babysitters for teenagers. Unfortunately, many malls
  have been forced to take on this role. One mall reported that misbehaving
  teens would hang over the railings. Sometimes teens would drop food or spit
  on customers below. At the same mall, two fifteen-year-olds fought over a
  pair of shoes. One of them was almost pushed over the railing. On another
  night, two gangs had a scuffle. One gang member had a gun and aimed it at an
  innocent bystander. After starting the parental-escort policy, the Mall of
  America, the largest mall in the country, reported a decrease from 300 to
  only 2 incidents involving bad behavior by teens.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Challenges to the Laws</h3> <p>In recent years
  there have been many challenges to curfew laws. The American Civil Liberties
  Union (ACLU) has participated in these challenges. ACLU spokespersons always
  want to protect the rights of people according to the Constitution. Their
  main complaints regard the hard to understand, or unclear, wording of the
  laws and the manner in which they are enforced. They feel that officers
  often target young people based on race.</p> </aside> <p>Big groups of teens
  who yell and fight create discomfort in older customers. Therefore, many
  older customers began to avoid the mall on Friday and Saturday nights. Since
  older customers have more money than most teens, mall managers want to
  encourage them to come back to the mall. One mall reported a 29% increase in
  revenue on Friday and Saturday nights after the curfew was started. Thus,
  the curfew not only makes the mall safer and more comfortable for all of the
  mallâ€™s customers, but it also makes the mall more profitable as well.</p>
