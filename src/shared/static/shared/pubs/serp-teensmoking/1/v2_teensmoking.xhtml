  <body><h1>Teen Smoking: Who is Responsible?</h1> <p>The effects of cigarette
  smoking cause nearly one in five deaths in the U.S. each year. Smoking is
  linked with cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. It is now widely
  acknowledged to be addictive. Once people start, they have trouble stopping.
  You can sometimes find it easy to tell whether someone smokes or not.
  Smokers often exhibit symptoms such as coughing, low energy, respiratory
  difficulties, and poor circulation. These problems often build over time.
  Doctors believe it is inevitable that smoking will eventually lead to an
  accumulation of health concerns.</p> <figure><img

  advertising to blame for teen smoking?</figcaption></figure> <p>So why do
  people smoke? Some say smoking keeps them calm. Others think it makes them
  look cool. Teen smoking rates are lower than they once were. Still, 23% of
  high school students and 8% of middle school students smoke. Many people
  think tobacco companies should follow stricter guidelines about marketing to
  teens.</p> <p>Companies use appealing advertisements and other techniques to
  manipulate kids into buying cigarettes. For instance, one brand developed
  flavored cigarettes and publicized them with fun, tropical images. Another
  brand advertised with hip-hop themes. Critics argue that these actions
  contradict statements by tobacco companies that they are trying to prevent
  kids from smoking.</p> <p>These companies say they support laws that block
  kidsâ€™ access to cigarettes. Should companies be held responsible for
  attracting kids to cigarettes? Is it the job of parents, teachers, and
  lawmakers to prevent teen smoking? Or should kids be responsible for their
  own choices?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
