  <body><h1>Teen Smoking: Who is Responsible?</h1> <p>The effects of cigarette
  smoking currently cause nearly one in five deaths in the U.S. each year.
  Smoking is associated with health conditions such as cancer, heart disease,
  and lung disease. In addition, smoking is now widely conceded to be
  addictive. Once people start smoking, they have trouble stopping because of
  the addictive qualities of smoking. Oftentimes you can easily discern if
  someone is a smoker or not. Smokers often exhibit symptoms such as coughing,
  low energy, respiratory difficulties, and poor circulation. These health
  problems often build and get progressively worse over time. Doctors believe
  it is inevitable that smoking will ultimately lead to an accumulation of
  health concerns. </p> <figure><img

  advertising to blame for teen smoking?</figcaption></figure> <p>So why do
  people smoke? Some say smoking keeps them calm. Others think it makes them
  look cool. Teen smoking rates are lower than they have been in the past.
  Nevertheless, currently 23% of high school students and 8% of middle school
  students smoke. Many people think tobacco companies should follow stricter
  guidelines about merchandising to youth and teens.</p> <p>Companies use
  captivating advertisements and other techniques to manipulate kids into
  purchasing and consuming cigarettes. For instance, one brand developed
  flavored cigarettes and championed them with fun, tropical images. Another
  brand advertised with hip-hop themes. Critics contend that these actions
  contradict assertions by tobacco companies that they are trying to prevent
  kids from smoking.</p> <p>These companies say they encourage and champion
  laws that block kidsâ€™ access to cigarettes. Should companies be held
  responsible for attracting kids to cigarettes? Is it the job of parents,
  teachers, and lawmakers to prevent teen smoking? Or should kids be
  responsible for the choices they, themselves, make?</p> <hr />
