  <body><h1>Teen Smoking: Who is Responsible?</h1> <p>Cigarette smoking causes
  almost one in five deaths in the U.S. each year. Smoking is linked with
  cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. It is recognized as addictive. Once
  people start, they have trouble stopping. It can be easy to tell if someone
  smokes. Smokers often exhibit signs like coughing, low energy, breathing
  difficulties, and poor circulation. These problems get worse over time.
  Doctors believe it is inevitable that smoking will someday lead to an
  accumulation of health problems. </p> <figure><img

  advertising to blame for teen smoking?</figcaption></figure> <p>So why do
  people smoke? Some say smoking keeps them calm. Others think it makes them
  look cool. Today, teen smoking rates are lower than in the past. Still, 23%
  of high school students smoke. Eight percent of middle school students
  smoke. Many people think tobacco companies should follow tougher guidelines
  about selling to teens.</p> <p>Companies use pleasing advertisements and
  other ways to manipulate kids to smoke. For instance, one brand made
  flavored cigarettes and advertised them with fun, tropical images. Another
  brand advertised with hip-hop themes. Critics argue that these actions
  contradict statements that tobacco companies are trying to stop kids from
  smoking.</p> <p>Companies say they support laws that block kidsâ€™ getting
  cigarettes. Should the companies be held responsible for kids who smoke? Is
  it the job of parents, teachers, and lawmakers to stop teen smoking? Should
  kids be responsible for their own choices?</p>
