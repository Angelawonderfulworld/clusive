  have eaten doughnuts, but have you ever wondered where the first doughnuts
  were made? Who thought up the idea of a fried baked good with a hole in the
  center? </span></p><figure><img

  knows for sure who made the first doughnuts, but some people believe that
  doughnuts were first invented in the 1800s as Dutch “olykoeks” or “oily
  cakes.” A cook in those days would want to avoid wasting any food, even
  scraps, so unused pieces of bread dough were put into hot oil and fried and
  made into Olykoeks. Olykoeks were tasty on the outside, but less appetizing
  in the center, where they were soggy and uncooked.</span></p><p><span>Some
  people say that the mother of a New England sea captain invented the first
  genuine doughnut. Elizabeth Gregory substituted the soggy center with a
  center filled with delicious spices and nuts. However, Elizabeth's son,
  Captain Gregory, did not like nuts, and that lead to other ideas of how the
  first genuine doughnut came about. Captain Gregory, it is said, punched out
  the center, and the outcome was the first hole in a doughnut. Sound
  unlikely? Well, others think that Captain Gregory saw holed pastries in
  Europe and brought the idea back to America with him, making him the
  inventor of the contemporary doughnut. </span></p><p><span>During World War
  I, homesick American soldiers in Europe were served doughnuts by the
  Salvation Army. These brave women volunteering for the job were called
  “Doughnut Girls.” These women often worked in perilous conditions near the
  fighting, so they wore helmets and uniforms. The women made doughnut cutters
  out of a large can with a smaller can inside it to cut out the hole. They
  could set up a metal cooking pot of hot oil to fry the dough almost
  anywhere. </span></p><p><span>In the 1920s, doughnut machines were invented
  so that, rather than being made by hand, doughnut machines manufactured the
  tasty pastries faster and easier than ever before. Still, many people
  preferred to make their favorite doughnut recipes at
  home.</span></p><p><span>Today, doughnuts are available at markets,
  bakeries, and coffee shops. Most people have a favorite type. You might like
  sugar-glazed doughnuts, doughnuts dipped in chocolate, or doughnuts covered
  in sprinkles. Perhaps you prefer doughnuts that don't even have holes, like
  maple bars, twisted cinnamon, or jelly-filled doughnuts. Then again, when
  you go to the bakery, you might just like to eat the doughnut holes.
  Yum!</span></p></section> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
