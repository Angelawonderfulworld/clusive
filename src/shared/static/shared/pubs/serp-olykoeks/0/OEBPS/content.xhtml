  have eaten doughnuts. Have you ever wondered where the first doughnuts were
  made? Who thought up the idea of a fried bread with a hole in the middle?

  knows for sure who made the first doughnuts. Some people think that
  doughnuts probably began in the 1800s. In Denmark, people made “olykoeks” or
  “oily cakes.” A cook would not want to waste any scraps of food. Leftover
  pieces of bread dough were put into hot oil and fried. Olykoeks were tasty
  on the outside, but uncooked in the middle. That made the middle of the
  cakes soggy.</span></p><p><span>Her name was Elizabeth Gregory. She replaced
  the soggy center with spices and nuts. Elizabeth's son, Captain Gregory, did
  not like nuts, so he punched out the center. The outcome was the first hole
  in a doughnut. Others think that Captain Gregory saw holed pastries in
  Europe. They think he brought that idea back to America.
  </span></p><p><span>Some people say that the mother of a New England sea
  captain made the first real doughnut. Her name was Elizabeth Gregory. She
  traded the soggy center with spices and nuts. But Elizabeth's son, Captain
  Gregory, did not like nuts, so he punched out the center. The outcome was
  the first hole in a doughnut. Others think that Captain Gregory saw holed
  pastries in Europe. They think he brought that idea back to
  America.</span></p><p><span>During World War I, homesick American soldiers
  in Europe were served doughnuts. Brave women volunteered to make the
  doughnuts. They were called “Doughnut Girls.” Doughnut Girls wore helmets
  and uniforms. They often worked in dangerous conditions. The women made
  doughnut cutters out of a large can with a smaller can inside it to cut out
  the hole. They could set up a pot of hot oil to fry the dough almost
  anywhere.</span><br /></p><p><span>Doughnut machines were invented in the
  1920s. Machines made doughnuts faster and easier than before. Still, many
  people preferred to make their favorite doughnuts at
  home.</span><br /><br /><span>Today, doughnuts are available in many places.
  Most people have a favorite kind. You might like sugar-glazed doughnuts,
  doughnuts dipped in chocolate, or doughnuts covered in sprinkles.  Maybe you
  prefer doughnuts that don't even have holes, like maple bars, twisted
  cinnamon, or jelly-filled doughnuts. Then again, you might just like to eat
  the doughnut holes. Yum!</span></p></section> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
