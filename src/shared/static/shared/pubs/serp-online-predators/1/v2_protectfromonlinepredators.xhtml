  <body><h1>Who is Responsible for Protecting Teens From Online
  Predators?</h1> <p>Sixteen-year-old Matt describes himself as a 24-year-old
  intellectual on his MySpace profile. He says it is “easier to be taken
  seriously if people don’t know they’re talking to a 16 year-old” (Lenhart
  &amp; Madden, 2007). Matt’s story is an example of how easy it is to lie on
  social networking websites.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">National Center for Missing and Exploited
  Children</h3> <p>The main function of this organization is to help parents
  and law enforcement agencies find missing children. It also works to make
  the public more aware of how to prevent child kidnapping, child abuse, and
  child pornography. This organization has released a couple of books to help
  children and parents think about how to remain safe from online predators.
  The organization emphasizes the importance of parents talking to their
  children about safety so that they know what to do in a real life
  situation.</p> </aside> <p>Matt’s lie may seem harmless, but some lies can
  put people in danger. Sometimes forty- and fifty-year-olds pose as teenagers
  on the Internet. Sometimes they contact teenagers through a website to try
  to become their friends. Sometimes they say sexual things. Sometimes they
  will ask for personal information, such as a telephone number or an address.
  The adults are looking for someone to harm or exploit, and they think lonely
  or insecure teens are prime targets. These adults are called online
  predators.</p> <p>It is sometimes difficult for a teenager to know how to
  deal with strangers online. Many teenagers try to have as many online
  friends as possible. They often accept any “friend request.”</p>

  from predators when they go online? </figcaption></figure> <p>Some people
  think social media websites should be responsible for protecting teens from
  online predators. They say that they need to do more to ensure that people
  are not posing as someone else. For example, they believe that social media
  sites should find a method to check users’ real identities. Others believe
  that these sites should raise the minimum age to 18 instead of the current
  limit, 14. Raising the minimum age will not stop imposters, but might make
  teenagers and parents more aware of the dangers. Moreover,
  eighteen-year-olds are legal adults and should be able to use social media
  sites safely.</p> <aside> <h3 class="article-sidebar-title">Legal Ages</h3>
  <p>In most of the United States an 18 year-old is considered a legal adult.
  This means they are old enough to legally work, vote, marry, join the
  military, and give sexual consent. If a young person is under 18, they can
  get written consent or permission from their parents for some purposes. The
  idea is that at 18 most young people are old enough to make thoughtful,
  mature decisions. Their parents are no longer responsible for them. The age
  of 18, as the legal adult age, has changed over the years. For example,
  until 1971, with the passing of the 26<sup>th</sup> Amendment, the legal age
  to vote in the United States was 21. The argument to pass the
  26<sup>th</sup> Amendment was that young men and women went to war and often
  were killed at the age of 18, but they were still not allowed to vote.</p>
  </aside> <p>Others say MySpace cannot do any more than it is already is
  doing. There is no method to check a user’s real identity. If MySpace raises
  the minimum age, teens might go to unmonitored web sites. These web sites
  may be even more dangerous. Some think middle and high school students
  should have their own social networking site that has the safeguard of a
  school-affiliated email address.</p> <p>Some think that the schools have
  enough to do and it would be too difficult and costly for them to protect
  teens from online predators. They think parents are responsible for keeping
  their children safe by monitoring their teen's internet use. For example,
  putting the family computer in a common space, such as the living room or
  family den, is one way that parents can monitor their internet
  activities.</p> <p>What do you think? Who should protect teens from online
  predators?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
