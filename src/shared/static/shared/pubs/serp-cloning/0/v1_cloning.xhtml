  <body><h1>Cloning: Threat or Opportunity?</h1> <figure><img

  cloning?</figcaption></figure> <p>What makes you who you are? Both your
  genes and your experiences have an impact on you. Your genes contain
  information about your own particular design. They help cause many of your
  features. Your genes cause your eye color, your height. They even cause
  which hand you use to write.</p> <p>Scientists have invented a set of steps
  called cloning. Cloning lets scientists to copy the genes of living things,
  or organisms. Scientists transfer some of an adult organismâ€™s genes to a new
  egg. After the transfer, a copy of the original organism starts to develop.
  Researchers are using one type of cloning to find new treatments for
  diseases like cancer. They believe that cloning has the potential to help
  people with important illnesses. Many farmers are cloning plants. They can
  produce crops featuring qualities that people like, such as juiciness in
  tomatoes. Some farmers are interested in cloning animals, too. They want to
  clone cattle that produce particularly tasty and tender beef.</p> <p>In the
  future, scientists may be able to clone a person. This process could create
  identical twins born at different times. Is that a good idea? Many people
  worry about how cloning will impact us. What would happen if people could
  design other people? What if leaders could choose the features they wanted
  their soldiers to have and then make an army of clones? What if parents
  could clone their children? Should people be allowed to clone their pets?
  How might we take advantage of the help cloning offers while stopping
  potential problems?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
