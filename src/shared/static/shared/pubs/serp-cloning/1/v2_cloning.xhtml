  <body><h1>Cloning: Threat or Opportunity?</h1> <figure><img

  cloning?</figcaption></figure> <p>What makes you who you are? Both your
  genes and your experiences have an impact on your identity. Your genes
  contain information about your own unique design. They help determine many
  of your features, such as your eye color, your height, and which hand you
  use to write.</p> <p>Scientists have invented a process called cloning that
  allows them to copy the genes of living things, or organisms. Scientists
  transfer some of an adult organismâ€™s genes to a new egg. After the transfer,
  a clone or copy of the original organism starts to develop. Researchers are
  using one type of cloning to study new treatments for diseases like cancer.
  They believe that cloning has the potential to help people with serious
  illnesses. Many farmers are cloning plants to produce crops featuring
  qualities that people like, such as juiciness in tomatoes. Some farmers are
  interested in cloning animals, too. For instance, they want to clone cattle
  that produce particularly tasty and tender beef.</p> <p>In the future,
  scientists may be able to clone a person. This process could create
  identical twins born at different times. But is that a good idea? Many
  people worry about how cloning will impact our lives. What would happen if
  people could design other people? What if, for example, leaders could choose
  the features they wanted their soldiers to have and then make an army of
  clones? What if parents could clone their children? Should people be allowed
  to clone their pets? How might we take advantage of the benefits cloning
  offers while preventing potential problems?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
