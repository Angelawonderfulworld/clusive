  Tubman</strong><br /><strong>Born:</strong> c. 1820, Dorchester County,
  Maryland<br /><strong>Died:</strong> March 10, 1913, Auburn, New York
  <p>Harriet Tubman was a runaway slave from Maryland. She became known as the
  "Moses of her people." Over the course of 10 years, and at great personal
  risk, she led hundreds of slaves to freedom along the Underground Railroad.
  The Underground Railroad was a secret network of safe houses where runaway
  slaves could stay on their journey north to freedom. She later became a
  leader in the abolitionist movement. During the Civil War she was a spy for
  the federal forces in South Carolina as well as a nurse.</p><h3>Tubman's
  Early Years and Escape from Slavery</h3><figure><img

  her charge around 1855.</figcaption></figure> <p>Harriet Tubman's name at
  birth was Araminta Ross. She was one of 11 children of Harriet and Benjamin
  Ross. She was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland. As a child,
  Ross was "hired out" by her master as a nursemaid for a small baby. Ross had
  to stay awake all night so that the baby wouldn't cry and wake the mother.
  If Ross fell asleep, the baby's mother whipped her. From a very young age,
  Ross was determined to get her freedom. Can you imagine what other kinds of
  embarrassment Ross suffered as a slave?</p> <figure><img

  whipped in "The Lash," 1863.</figcaption></figure> <p>As a slave, Araminta
  Ross was scarred for life when she refused to help in the punishment of
  another young slave. A young man had gone to the store without permission.
  When he returned, the overseer wanted to whip him. He asked Ross to help.
  She refused. The young man started to run away. The overseer picked up a
  heavy iron weight and threw it at him. He missed the young man and hit Ross
  instead. The weight nearly crushed her skull. It left a deep scar. She was
  unconscious for days. She suffered from fits for the rest of her life.</p>

  Tubman called "Moses".</figcaption></figure> <p>In 1844, Ross married a free
  black named John Tubman and took his last name. She also changed her first
  name. She took her mother's name, Harriet. In 1849, Harriet worried that she
  and the other slaves on the plantation were going to be sold. She decided to
  run away. Her husband refused to go with her. She set out with her two
  brothers. They followed the North Star in the sky as a guide north to
  freedom. Her brothers became frightened. They turned back. Harriet continued
  on and reached Philadelphia. There she found work as a household servant.
  She saved her money so she could return to help others escape.</p>
  <h3>Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad</h3> <figure><img
  alt="reward poster for capturing runaway slaves"
  src="images/06_tubman_poster.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 5: A reward poster for
  runaway slaves, 1847.</figcaption></figure> <p>After Harriet Tubman escaped
  from slavery, she returned to slave-holding states many times to help other
  slaves escape. She led them safely to the northern free states and to
  Canada. It was very dangerous to be a runaway slave. There were rewards for
  their capture. Ads like you see here described slaves in detail. Whenever
  Tubman led a group of slaves to freedom, she placed herself in great danger.
  There was a bounty offered for her capture because she was a fugitive slave
  herself. She was breaking the law in slave states by helping other slaves
  escape. What do you think Tubman did when someone she was helping became
  frightened and wanted to turn back?</p> <figure><img
  alt="page of music for song, &quot;Go down, Moses&quot;"
  src="images/07_tubman_music.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 6: Sheet music from "Go
  down, Moses (Let my people go!)"</figcaption></figure> <p>If anyone ever
  wanted to change his or her mind during the journey to freedom and return,
  Tubman pulled out a gun and said, "You'll be free or die a slave!" Tubman
  knew that if anyone turned back, it would put her and the other escaping
  slaves in danger of discovery, capture or even death. She became so well
  known for leading slaves to freedom that Tubman became known as the "Moses
  of Her People." Many slaves dreaming of freedom sang the spiritual "Go Down
  Moses." Slaves hoped a savior would deliver them from slavery just as Moses
  had delivered the Israelites from slavery.</p> <figure><img
  alt="painting of escaping slaves traveling in snow"

  along the Underground Railroad, depicted in this
  painting.</figcaption></figure> <p>Tubman made 19 trips to Maryland. She
  helped 300 people to freedom. During these dangerous journeys she helped
  rescue members of her own family, including her 70-year-old parents. At one
  point, rewards for Tubman's capture totaled $40,000. Yet, she was never
  captured. She never failed to deliver her "passengers" to safety. As Tubman
  herself said, "On my Underground Railroad I [never] run my train off [the]
  track [and] I never [lost] a passenger."</p> <h3>Tubman During the Civil
  War</h3> <figure><img alt="photo of Civil War gunboat"
  src="images/09_tubman_gunboat.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 8: Gunboat Mendota,
  used in the Civil War. </figcaption></figure> <p>During the Civil War,
  Tubman worked for the Union army as a nurse, a cook, and a spy. Her
  experience leading slaves along the Underground Railroad was especially
  helpful. She knew the land well. She recruited a group of former slaves to
  hunt for rebel camps and report on the movement of the Confederate troops.
  In 1863, she went with Colonel James Montgomery and about 150 black soldiers
  on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. Because she had inside information from
  her scouts, the Union gunboats were able to surprise the Confederate rebels.
  How do you think the slaves reacted to this activity?</p> <figure><img
  alt="fugitive slaves crossing river"
  src="images/10_tubman_river.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 9: Fugitive African
  Americans run to the river. </figcaption></figure> <p>At first when the
  Union Army came through and burned plantations, slaves hid in the woods. But
  when they understood that the gunboats could take them behind Union lines to
  freedom, they came running from all directions. They brought as many of
  their belongings as they could carry. Tubman later said, "I never saw such a
  sight." Tubman played other roles in the war effort. She worked as a nurse.
  Folk remedies she learned during her years living in Maryland would come in
  very handy.</p> <figure><img alt="photo of water lillies"
  src="images/11_tubman_lily.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 10: Water lilies like
  the ones Tubman used to heal the sick. </figcaption></figure> <p>Tubman
  worked as a nurse during the war, trying to heal the sick. Many people in
  the hospital died from dysentery, a disease associated with terrible
  diarrhea. Tubman was sure she could help cure the sickness if she could find
  some of the same roots and herbs that grew in Maryland. One night she
  searched the woods until she found water lilies and crane's bill (geranium).
  She boiled the water lily roots and the herbs and made a bitter-tasting brew
  that she gave to a man who was dying-and it worked! Slowly he recovered.
  Tubman saved many people in her lifetime. On her grave her tombstone reads
  "Servant of God, Well Done."</p> <hr /> <p>Text credits:</p>America's
