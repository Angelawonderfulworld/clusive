  class="c5">Escape Artist</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c4">What has
  eight arms, two eyes, and a beak? You guessed it. The octopus. It doesn’t
  have a nose, ears, or fingers, but each arm is covered with a double row of
  </span> <span class="c4">white cups</span> <span class="c4"> called </span>
  <span class="c2">suckers</span> <span class="c4">. It uses these suckers to
  explore its world. Each sucker moves by itself like the way we wiggle our
  toes or fingers. And a sucker not only holds onto objects, it tastes them.
  An octopus has a beak like a bird, and a tongue—called a </span> <span
  class="c2">radula</span> <span class="c4">—that’s covered with very sharp
  teeth. These teeth can cut through crab and snail shells like a </span>
  <span class="c4">saw</span> <span class="c4">. An octopus will often carry a
  crab back to its </span><span class="c4">home </span><span class="c3">for
  dinner. Then, after it’s finished eating, the octopus will deposit the
  shells just outside its home. Very tidy!</span></p>

  <p class="c0">The octopus is the great shape-shifter of
  the sea. It can make itself big like an umbrella. It can make itself long
  and thin like a piece of rope. It can squeeze through cracks under a rock.
  It can flatten itself against the walls of a cave. The octopus is also a
  master at <span class="c4"> hiding</span> <span class="c4">. Its skin
  can change color </span> <span class="c4">very quickly</span> <span
  class="c3">. This is a way to protect itself from sharks and other dangerous
  animals.</span> </p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">When it comes to brains,
  the octopus goes to the head of the class. It is the smartest of all animals
  without bones. It can find its way through a maze or figure out how to
  unscrew the lid of a jar and remove the tasty fish that’s inside. The
  octopus is a very curious </span> <span class="c4">animal</span> <span
  class="c3"> and can even die of boredom if kept in a tank with no world to
  explore and nothing to interest it.</span> </p><p class="c16"><span
  class="c4">It can be sneaky, too. Scientists at an </span> <span
  class="c4">aquarium</span> <span class="c4"> were confused by an </span>
  <span class="c4">unexplained </span> <span class="c3">disappearing act.
  Every day they’d place new fish in a tank, but when they returned in the
  morning, the fish would be gone. Finally, they set up a video camera to see
  who was stealing the fish. They watched in surprise as an octopus in a tank
  across the room waited for the museum to close, then squeezed its way out of
  its tank, slid across the floor, slipped into the fish tank, and ate all the
  fish. Then it crawled back into its own tank and took a
  nap!</span></p><hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
