  Artist</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c2">What has eight arms, two
  eyes, and a beak? You guessed it. The octopus. While it does not have a
  nose, ears, or fingers, each of the octopus's arms is covered with a double
  row of white </span> <span class="c2">suction </span> <span class="c2">cups
  called </span> <span class="c2 c9">suckers</span> <span class="c2">. These
  suckers are sensory organs that an octopus uses to explore its world. Each
  individual sucker moves by itself, similar to the way humans wiggle their
  toes or fingers. Even more interesting, each sucker not only </span> <span
  class="c2">grips</span> <span class="c2"> objects, it tastes them as well.
  An octopus has a beak like a bird, and a tongue—called a </span> <span
  class="c2 c9">radula</span> <span class="c2">—that's covered with
  razor-sharp teeth, and that enable an octopus to cut through crab and snail
  shells like a </span> <span class="c2">buzzsaw</span> <span class="c2">. An
  octopus will often carry a crab back to its </span> <span class="c2">den
  </span> <span class="c8 c2">for dinner. Then, after it's finished eating,
  the octopus will deposit the empty shells just outside its den. Very
  tidy!</span> </p>

  class="c2">The octopus is the great shape-shifter of the sea. It can expand
  and become wide like an umbrella, or elongate and become thin like a piece
  of rope. An octopus can squeeze through cracks under a rock or flatten
  itself against the walls of a cave. Not only can the octopus modify its
  shape whenever it wants, it can change its appearance, too. Some people have
  called the octopus a master of </span> <span class="c2">disguise</span>
  <span class="c2">. Its skin can change color </span> <span
  class="c2">instantaneously</span> <span class="c2">, acting as a </span>
  <span class="c2">camouflage</span> <span class="c2"> to protect it from
  sharks and other </span> <span class="c2">predators</span> <span
  class="c8 c2">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When it comes to
  brains, the octopus goes to the head of the class. It is the smartest of all
  invertebrates. It can find its way through a maze or figure out how to
  unscrew the lid of a jar and remove the tasty fish that's inside. The
  octopus is a very curious </span> <span class="c2">organism</span> <span
  class="c2"> and can actually die of boredom if kept in a tank with no world
  to explore and nothing to </span> <span class="c2">entertain</span> <span
  class="c8 c2"> it.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">It can be
  pretty sneaky, too. Scientists at an </span> <span
  class="c2">aquarium</span> <span class="c2"> were </span> <span
  class="c2">baffled</span> <span class="c2"> by an </span> <span
  class="c2">inexplicable </span> <span class="c2">disappearing act. Every day
  they’d place new fish in a tank, but when they returned in the morning, the
  fish would be gone. Finally, they set up a video camera to see who was
  stealing the fish. They watched in </span> <span class="c2">amazement</span>
  <span class="c2 c8"> as an octopus in a tank across the room waited for the
  museum to close, then squeezed its way out of its tank, slid across the
  floor, slipped into the fish tank, and consumed all the fish. Then it
  crawled back into its own tank and took a nap!</span> </p><hr />
