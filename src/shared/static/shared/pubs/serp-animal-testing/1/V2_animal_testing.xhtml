  <body><h1>Animal Testing: Is it Necessary?</h1> <figure><img

  src="images/animaltesting_cover.jpg" /><figcaption>Animals are used to test a range
  of products, including drugs that may cure diseases as well as cosmetics and
  shampoo. </figcaption></figure> <p>Animals are used in research by
  scientists seeking cures for disease. They are also used by pharmaceutical
  and cosmetic companies to test drugs, makeup, lotions, soaps, and shampoos.
  Why do we rely on animals to test our products for safety? Because animals
  share many genes and organs with humans, scientists say that using them
  advances knowledge and protects humans from potentially harmful effects of
  new products.</p> <p>If animal testing is designed to protect humans, then
  why do so many people react negatively to it? Today, more and more people
  will not buy products tested on animals because they consider animal testing
  cruel and unnecessary. Companies that use alternative methods of testing
  products are advertising to people who donâ€™t mind buying shampoo or laundry
  detergent that is a bit more expensive in order to avoid products tested on
  animals.</p> <p>Medical researchers say that only a small proportion of
  animals are used in painful or dangerous tests. Animal rights defenders say
  even one is too many.</p> <p>Is it okay to test drugs or makeup on animals?
  Do humans have more rights than animals? Is animal testing justified because
  it helps humans?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
