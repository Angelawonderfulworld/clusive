  <body><h1>Animal Testing: Is it Necessary?</h1><figure><img

  src="images/animaltesting_cover.jpg" /><figcaption>Animals are used to test
  a range of products, including drugs that may cure diseases as well as
  cosmetics and shampoo. </figcaption></figure><p>Animals are used in studies
  by scientists. They use animals to look for cures for disease. Animals are
  also used by drug and makeup companies to test drugs, makeup, lotions,
  soaps, and shampoos. Why do we rely on animals to test for safety? Because
  animals share many genes and organs with humans. Scientists say that using
  animals boosts knowledge and protects humans from possibly harmful effects
  of new products.</p><p>If animal testing is designed to protect humans, then
  why do many people react negatively to it? Today, more and more people will
  not buy products tested on animals. They consider animal testing cruel and
  unnecessary. Companies that use alternative routines of testing products
  advertise to people. Some people donâ€™t mind buying shampoo or laundry
  detergent that is a bit more expensive in order to avoid products tested on
  animals.</p><p>Medical researchers say that only a small proportion of
  animals are used in painful or dangerous tests. Animal rights defenders say
  even one is too many.</p><p>Is it okay to test with animals? Do humans have
  more rights than animals? Is animal testing justified because it helps
  people?</p><hr /> <p>Credits:</p><p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
