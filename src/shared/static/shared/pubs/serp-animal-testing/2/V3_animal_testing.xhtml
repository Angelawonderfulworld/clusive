  <body><h1>Animal Testing: Is it Necessary?</h1> <figure><img

  src="images/animaltesting_cover.jpg" /><figcaption>Animals are used to test a range
  of products, including drugs that may cure diseases as well as cosmetics and
  shampoo. </figcaption></figure> <p>Animals are used in analyses by
  scientists probing for cures for a variety of dangerous diseases that can
  disrupt human life. They are also used by pharmaceutical and cosmetic
  companies to evaluate the safety of drugs, makeup, lotions, soaps, and
  shampoos. Why do we rely on animals to test our products for human safety?
  The reason is in the fact that animals share many genes and organs with
  humans; because of this, scientists say, using animals enhances knowledge
  while it likewise protects humans from presumably harmful effects of new
  products.</p> <p>If animal testing is designed to protect humans, then why
  do so many people react negatively to it? Today, more and more people
  refused to purchase products tested on animals because they consider animal
  testing cruel, inhumane, and unnecessary. Some companies understand consumer
  discomfort with animal testing. These companies use alternative procedures
  of testing products and then advertising to people who donâ€™t mind buying
  shampoo or laundry detergent that is a bit more expensive in order to avoid
  products tested on animals.</p> <p>Medical researchers say that only a small
  proportion of animals are used in painful or dangerous tests. Animal rights
  defenders say even one is too many.</p> <p>Is it appropriate to test drugs
  or makeup on animals? Do humans have more rights than animals? Is animal
  testing justified because it helps humans?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
