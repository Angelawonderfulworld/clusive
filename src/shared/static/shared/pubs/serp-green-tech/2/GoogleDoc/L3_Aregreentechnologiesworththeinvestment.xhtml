  class="c2 c14">Are green technologies worth the investment?</span></h1><p
  class="c3"> <span class="c0">As Amanda walked through the park, she noticed
  a big new trash can called a BigBelly. When she researched this new
  technology on the web, it turned out that this trash can costs $6,000! The
  BigBelly contains a solar-powered compactor inside, so it </span> <span
  class="c0">maximizes </span> <span class="c0">the quantity of trash
  contained in the can while </span> <span class="c0">diminishing </span>
  <span class="c0">the number of times it needs to be emptied. The BigBelly is
  one of many “green </span> <span class="c0">technologies</span> <span
  class="c0">” now available. However, does it make sense to </span> <span
  class="c0">invest </span> <span class="c0">so much money in them? City
  managers and mayors say that the BigBelly is worth the investment, as each
  BigBelly will pay for itself in three years because the cans only need to be
  emptied once a week. Traditional trash cans get emptied once or twice a day
  at a cost of about $2,000 a year each, and the trucks that travel around to
  empty them use gasoline and </span> <span class="c0">contaminate </span>
  <span class="c0">the atmosphere. Nevertheless, buying a lot of BigBelly cans
  could be a costly expenditure for in any city's budget!</span></p>

  class="c11"><span class="c0">The BigBelly uses a </span> <span
  class="c0">renewable </span> <span class="c0">energy source, solar energy
  from the sun. Currently, there are many other renewable technologies </span>
  <span class="c0">emerging</span> <span class="c0"> as well. Consumers are
  installing solar panels on their roofs and converting to solar-powered
  electricity from electricity produced with coal or gas.  Solar-powered cars
  and planes are under development. Solar-powered light strips have been
  </span> <span class="c0">situated </span> <span class="c0">on some rural
  highways; once in place, the light strips run for free and rarely require
  </span> <span class="c0">supervision</span> <span class="c0">. Investors are
  putting funds into developing solar panels that may someday replace the
  asphalt on highways; these panels use solar power to generate heat, so that
  ice and snow melt immediately, light, so that streetlamps are unnecessary,
  and additional electricity that nearby towns and cities will be able to
  use.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">Investment in these solar
  technologies is extremely costly. The Department of Transportation gave
  $100,000 to the solar pavement project, but several million more will be
  needed just to finish the development. Are such expensive technologies worth
  this costly investment? Should we proceed to invest in technologies that may
  never </span> <span class="c0">be operational </span> <span class="c0">on a
  large scale? Shouldn't we </span> <span class="c0">conserve </span> <span
  class="c0">public funds for more urgent and immediate needs, like improving
  schools and fixing potholes? What if we develop green technologies but are
  deficient in the funds to </span> <span class="c0">proceed </span> <span
  class="c0 c2">with using them? How high a price should we pay for green
  technology?</span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
