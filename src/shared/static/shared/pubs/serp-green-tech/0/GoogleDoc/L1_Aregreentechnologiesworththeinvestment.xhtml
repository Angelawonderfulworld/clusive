  class="c7 c16">Are green technologies worth the investment?</span></h1><p
  class="c9"> <span class="c2">As Amanda walked through the park, she noticed
  a big new trash can called a BigBelly. When she looked it up on the web, it
  turned out to cost $6,000! The BigBelly has a solar-powered compactor
  inside. It </span> <span class="c2">maximizes </span> <span class="c2">the
  amount of trash it holds, while </span> <span class="c2">lessening </span>
  <span class="c2">the number of times it needs to be emptied. The BigBelly is
  one of many “green </span> <span class="c2">technologies</span> <span
  class="c2">” now available. But does it make sense to </span> <span
  class="c2">invest </span> <span class="c2">so much money in them? City
  managers and mayors say that each BigBelly will pay for itself in three
  years. They only need to be emptied once a week. Traditional trash cans get
  emptied once or twice a day, at a cost of about $2,000 a year each. The
  trucks that travel around to empty them use gasoline and </span> <span
  class="c2">dirty </span> <span class="c2">the air. But buying a lot of
  BigBelly cans could punch a big hole in any city's budget!</span>

  class="c1"><span class="c2">The BigBelly uses a </span> <span
  class="c2">renewable </span> <span class="c2">energy source, the sun. Many
  other renewable technologies are </span> <span class="c2">growing</span>
  <span class="c7 c2">. Some people are putting solar panels on their roofs.
  Some are switching from electricity produced with coal or gas to
  solar-powered electricity. Solar-powered cars and planes</span> <span
  class="c2">are under development. Solar-powered light strips have been
  </span> <span class="c2">put </span> <span class="c2">on some rural
  highways. These light strips run for free and require little </span> <span
  class="c2">upkeep</span> <span class="c2">. Investors are developing solar
  panels that can replace the asphalt on highways.  These panels use solar
  power to generate heat (so that ice and snow melt immediately), light (so
  that streetlamps are unnecessary), and extra electricity for nearby towns
  and cities.</span> </p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Investment in these
  solar technologies is expensive. The Department of Transportation gave
  $100,000 to the solar pavement project, but several million more will be
  needed just to finish the development. Are these expensive technologies
  worth it? Should we keep putting money into technologies that may never
  </span> <span class="c2">work</span> <span class="c2"> on a large scale?
  Shouldn't we </span> <span class="c2">conserve </span> <span
  class="c2">public money for things like improving schools and fixing roads?
  What if we make green technologies but don't have the money to </span> <span
  class="c2">proceed </span> <span class="c7 c2">with using them? How high a
  price should we pay for green technology?</span> </p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
