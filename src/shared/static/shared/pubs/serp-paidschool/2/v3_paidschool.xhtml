  <body><h1>Should Students Be Paid to Do Well in School?</h1> <p>In September
  2007, New York City implemented a new initiative to try to motivate students
  to do well in school. The mayor wanted to undertake the task of raising
  student achievement in a new way, and so he offered students money as an
  incentive to try hard. Some fourth and seventh graders were paid up to $500
  per year for doing well on the city’s math and reading tests.</p>

  giving kids money for doing school work?</figcaption></figure> <p>Many
  people are excited about the mayor’s idea; they think this will make school
  more like the real world, where people earn money for working hard. Students
  might do better if they get instantaneous rewards; it is hard for them to
  wait for the “payoff” of getting into college or finding a good job.
  Moreover, they might learn more; knowing they will be paid for high scores
  could make students study harder.</p> <p>However, some people think that
  this is not fair. They worry about students who try their hardest, but still
  don’t score well enough on the test to get the reward, and those students
  might stop trying in the future. Also, many people believe that education
  should be its own reward; a good education makes someone a better analytical
  thinker and more innovative. It enables people to deal with endeavors they
  face. If students are only motivated by earning money, they might not
  understand that learning can be fun.</p> <p>Will New York City’s initiative
  help students succeed in school? Should students be paid for high test
  scores?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
