  <p><strong>Born:</strong> February 1817 (exact date uncertain)</p>
  <p><strong>Died: </strong>February 20, 1895</p> <p>Frederick Douglass once
  told a group of African American students from a school in Talbot County,
  Maryland, "What was possible for me is possible for you. Do not think
  because you are colored you cannot accomplish anything. Strive earnestly to
  add to your knowledge. So long as you remain in ignorance, so long will you
  fail to command the respect of your fellow men." Born Frederick Augustus
  Washington Bailey to a slave mother and a white father he never knew,
  Frederick Douglass grew up to become a leader in the abolitionist movement
  and the first black citizen to hold high rank (as U.S. minister and consul
  general to Haiti) in the U.S. government.</p>  <h3>Douglass's Escape from Slavery</h3> <figure><img

  Frederick Douglass. </figcaption></figure> <p>Can you believe that a train
  conductor held the fate of Frederick Douglass's entire life in his hands?
  Douglass described his daring escape on a train ride from Baltimore to
  Philadelphia in his autobiography, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass
  (1881). For the journey, Douglass disguised himself as a sailor wearing a
  red shirt, a tarpaulin hat, and a black scarf tied loosely around his neck.
  He also had to be able to talk like a sailor. "My knowledge of ships and
  sailor's talk came much to my assistance, for I knew a ship from stem to
  stern, and from keelson to cross-trees, and could talk sailor like an 'old
  salt.'" Besides a disguise, what else do you think Douglass needed?</p>
   <figure><img
  alt="seaman's protection certificate"

  protection certificate. </figcaption></figure> <p>Along with the other black
  passengers, Douglass had to show his "free papers"--a document proving he
  was free and could travel--along with his ticket. Because Douglass was a
  runaway slave, he didn't have free papers. Instead, he had borrowed what was
  called a Seaman's Protection Certificate, which proved that a sailor was a
  citizen of the U.S.</p> <p>Douglass described his nervousness when the
  conductor came by to collect tickets and look over papers: "My whole future
  depended upon the decision of this conductor."</p> <p>This is how the
  conversation went when the conductor reached Douglass in the crowded train
  car.</p>  <blockquote> <p>"I suppose
  you have your free papers?"</p> <p>"No sir; I never carry my free papers to
  sea with me."</p> <p>"But you have something to show that you are a freeman,
  haven't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir, I have a paper with the American eagle on
  it, and that will carry me around the world."</p> </blockquote> <p>A quick
  glance at the paper satisfied the conductor and he took Douglass's fare and
  went on to the other passengers. This moment was one of the most anxious
  Douglass had ever experienced. What do you think would have happened if the
  conductor had looked carefully at the paper?</p>  <figure><img

  src="images/05_douglass_song.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 5: The cover of "The
  Fugitive's Song." </figcaption></figure> <p>If the conductor had looked
  closely, he would have noticed that Douglass did not match the description
  of the person on the form and he would have been required to send him back
  to slavery in Baltimore. Not only would this have been terrible for Douglass
  but also the friend, from whom he borrowed the Seaman's Certificate, would
  have been in serious trouble. Later, when Douglass wrote his first
  autobiography in 1845, he didn't include the way in which he escaped because
  some of the people who had helped him could have gotten into trouble. By the
  time Douglass wrote his revised autobiography in 1881, he included the real
  description of his daring escape.</p> 
  <h3>Frederick Douglass--Abolitionist Leader</h3> <figure><img
  alt="The North Star newspaper, 1848"
  src="images/06_douglass_northstar.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 6: Page from "The
  North Star." </figcaption></figure> <p>After Douglass escaped, he wanted to
  promote freedom for all slaves. He published a newspaper in Rochester, New
  York, called The North Star. It got its name because slaves escaping at
  night followed the North Star in the sky to freedom. Douglass's goals were
  to "abolish slavery in all its forms and aspects, promote the moral and
  intellectual improvement of the COLORED PEOPLE, and hasten the day of
  FREEDOM to the Three Millions of our enslaved fellow countrymen." How else
  did Douglass promote freedom?</p> <p>In addition to publishing The North
  Star, Douglass lectured on the subject of freedom. Even though he had made a
  name for himself and was a successful leader in the abolitionist movement,
  he was still subject to laws keeping blacks separate from whites. On one
  occasion, he took the train to speak in a Southern city. During the journey,
  he was forced to sit in the section reserved for "colored" people at the end
  of the freight car. When his hosts met him at the other end, they were very
  apologetic that he had been humiliated and made to sit in the back of the
  car. His response was:"Gentlemen, by ignoble actions I may degrade myself,
  but nothing and no man can degrade Frederick Douglass."</p>  <figure><img

  early white male abolitionists. </figcaption></figure> <p>Frederick Douglass
  is known for his ability to speak and inspire a crowd, but he wasn't always
  confident talking in front of an audience. His very first public speech was
  in 1841 at the church of the Rev. Thomas James, who asked Douglass to speak
  about his experiences as a slave. At first, Douglass was nervous and shy,
  but as he went on, he became more sure of himself and his speaking skills.
  After that experience, he went in front of crowds on numerous occasions to
  speak out against slavery.</p> <p>Douglass kept company with other
  abolitionists, including Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, and Owen
  Lovejoy. He also spoke in favor of women's rights and worked alongside
  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony,
  and many others.</p>  <h3>Douglass's
  Role in the Civil War</h3> <figure><img
  alt="illustration of fighting soldiers"

  54th Massachusetts regiment in battle. </figcaption></figure> <p>African
  Americans were ready and willing to fight in the Civil War, but President
  Lincoln and Union leaders were not sure how they felt about enlisting black
  troops. By 1860, Douglass was well known for his efforts to end slavery and
  his skill at public speaking. During the Civil War, Douglass was a
  consultant to President Abraham Lincoln and helped convince him that slaves
  should serve in the Union forces and that the abolition of slavery should be
  a goal of the war.</p>  <figure><img

  Frederick Douglass from the U.S. War Department. </figcaption></figure>
  <p>On January 1, 1863, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation clearly stated
  that Confederate slaves were now free and they could serve in the Union
  army. By the end of the war, about 186,000 African American men had
  enlisted. Douglass also worked as a recruiter in several regions of the
  country signing up African Americans to serve in the Union army. This letter
  requests Douglass's presence to help in the recruitment effort. Whom do you
  think he signed up to serve?</p> 
  <figure><img alt="portrait of Charles Douglass"
  src="images/10_douglass_son.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 10: Charles
  Douglass.</figcaption></figure> <p>Douglass recruited his sons, Charles and
  Lewis, who both joined the famous 54th Massachusetts Regiment. This army
  unit was made up of black volunteers who fought a bitter battle at Fort
  Wagner, South Carolina, in July 1863. Here you see a photo of Charles,
  Douglass's third youngest son, who wrote to his father while he was in the
  army. In one letter Charles said he heard that "the colored people were
  rushing into Philadelphia and that yourself and . . . others were doing all
  you could for them[.]"</p> <hr /> <p>Text credit:</p>America's Library from
