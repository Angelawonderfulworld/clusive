  <body><section> <h1 id="header-1"> Should there be a grade requirement to
  participate in sports? </h1> <p><span>Svenka worked hard on her soccer
  skills and made the school team. When she got an F on her report card, the
  coach told her she was not eligible to play unless her grades improved. The
  school that Svenka attends, like many others around the country, has a rule:
  If you don't pass a class, you don't get to play. Svenka thinks that this is
  unfair. She does not think this one bad grade should affect her place on the
  team.</span></p><figure><img

  <figcaption><p>Participation in sports brings a lot of social and health
  benefits. Are grades more important,
  though?</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>Some people think that middle and
  high school students should maintain certain grade point averages to play
  sports. Many schools use grades as a prerequisite for participation in
  after-school activities. They feel that the students should work as hard in
  the classroom as on the field. If students really want to play, they should
  work extra hard in school to make sure that they
  can.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Not only does this rule encourage
  student-athletes to keep up with their schoolwork, it also motivates coaches
  to teach players how to balance their time. Coaches don't want their star
  athletes to fall behind in school and be dropped from the
  team.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, there are people who do not
  think grade requirements are a good idea. They think that forcing students
  to get a certain grade will keep too many from participating. In previous
  years, some students took easier classes just so they could play sports.
  This was unfair to the athletes who had to work harder to keep up their
  grades in challenging classes.</span></p><p><span>What do you think about
  this? Does the “no pass, no play” rule seem fair to you? Should middle and
  high school students have to meet a grade requirement to participate in
  sports?</span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p> <i>Text credit:</i> <a
