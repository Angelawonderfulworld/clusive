  <body><section> <h1 id="header-2"> Should there be a grade requirement to
  participate in sports? </h1> <section> <p><span>Svenka worked hard to
  develop and improve her soccer skills, and it showed when she made the
  school team. However, when she got an F on her report card, the coach told
  her she was no longer eligible to play unless her grades were ameliorated.
  The school that Svenka attends, like many others around the country, has a
  rule that if you don't pass a class, you don't get to play.  Svenka believes
  that this is unfair because she does not think this one bad grade should
  affect her place on the team.</span></p><figure><img

  of social and health benefits. Are grades more important,
  though?</figcaption></figure><p><span>Some people argue that middle and high
  school students should have to maintain certain grade point averages in
  order to play sports. This is not an unusual requirement. Many schools use
  grades as a prerequisite for partaking in numerous after-school activities.
  These schools enact this policy because they feel that the students should
  work as hard in the classroom as on the field. If students really want to
  play, they should work diligently on their academic work to ensure that they
  can.</span></p><p><span>Not only does this rule induce student athletes to
  keep up with their schoolwork, it also compels coaches to teach players how
  to balance their time. Coaches don't want their star athletes to neglect or
  fall behind in their schoolwork, because that will mean they will be dropped
  from the team.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, other people disagree
  and do not think grade requirements are a good idea. They think that forcing
  students to get a certain grade will keep too many from participating. In
  addition, requiring good grades has led to unanticipated consequences. In
  previous years, some students took easier classes just so they could play
  sports. This was unfair to the athletes who had to work harder to keep up
  their grades in arduous classes.</span></p><p><span>What do you think about
  this? Does the “no pass, no play” rule seem fair to you? Should middle and
  high school students have to meet a grade requirement to participate in
  sports?</span></p></section> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i>
