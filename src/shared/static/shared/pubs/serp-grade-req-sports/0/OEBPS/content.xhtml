  <body><section> <h1 id="header-2"> Should there be a grade requirement to
  participate in sports? </h1><section><p><span>Svenka worked hard on her
  soccer skills. She made the school team. But then she got an F on her report
  card. The coach told her she was not eligible to play. Her grades needed to
  get better.  Svenka's school has a rule: If you don't pass a class, you
  don't get to play. Other schools have this rule too. Svenka thinks it's not
  fair. One bad grade should affect her place on the
  team.</span></p><figure><img

  of social and health benefits. Are grades more important,
  though?</figcaption></figure><p><span>Some people say middle and high school
  students should maintain certain grade point averages to play sports. Many
  schools use grades as a prerequisite for joining after-school activities.
  They say students should work as hard in the classroom as on the field. If
  students really want to play, they should work extra hard in
  school.  </span></p><p><span>Some people say that this rule gets
  student-athletes to keep up with their schoolwork. It also gives coaches a
  good reason to teach players how to balance their time. Coaches don't want
  their star athletes to fall behind in school. They don't want athletes to be
  dropped from the team.</span></p><p><span>Other people do not think grade
  requirements are a good idea. They think that forcing students to get a
  certain grade keeps too many from participating. In previous years, some
  students took easier classes just so they could play sports. This was unfair
  to the athletes who worked to keep up their grades in hard
  classes.</span></p><p><span>What do you think about this? Does the “no pass,
  no play” rule seem fair to you? Should middle and high school students have
  to meet a grade requirement to participate in sports?</span></p></section>
