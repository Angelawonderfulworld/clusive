  class="c7"><span class="c0">Crawford Lake is a small lake west of Toronto.
  It is very deep. Lakes like this, called “meromictic lakes,” are found all
  over the world. But they are </span> <span class="c0">few </span> <span
  class="c2 c0">and of special interest to many scientists. Why?</span>
  </p><figure><img alt="Photo of a lake surrounded by rocks and mountains."

  can reveal clues to the past.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="c4"><span
  class="c0">In most lakes, the water mixes together. Mixing </span> <span
  class="c0">churns </span> <span class="c0">up the mud on the bottom. In
  meromictic lakes, the water is very deep. The mud doesn't get </span> <span
  class="c0">moved</span> <span class="c0">. Things that fall into the lake
  sink to the bottom. They pile up and stay there for thousands of years. They
  form layers that you can see. Because of this, palaeobotanists (scientists
  who study </span> <span class="c0">fossilized </span> <span
  class="c0 c2">plants) can look at the bottom mud and find out about the
  plants that lived on the shores of the lake long ago. </span></p><p
  class="c4"><span class="c0">That's just what happened at Crawford Lake in
  1971. A palaeobotanist decided to collect a </span> <span class="c0">small
  section </span> <span class="c0">of bottom mud to study the pollen </span>
  <span class="c0">grains</span> <span class="c0"> it </span> <span
  class="c0">held</span> <span class="c0">. He looked at the </span> <span
  class="c0">fossilized </span> <span class="c2 c0">pollen in the lake mud. He
  wanted to learn what plants had grown near the lake for hundreds of years
  and how they had changed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To
  collect bottom mud, the </span> <span class="c0">botanist </span> <span
  class="c2 c0">filled a heavy hollow tube with dry ice to make it freezing
  cold. He lowered this “frigid finger” into the lake and into the mud. When
  he pulled it up ten minutes later, it was coated with a thin crust of frozen
  mud.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Back at the lab, the botanist
  and his assistant studied the frozen crust. They could see layers, two for
  each year. The top two layers were from 1971. The further down they went,
  the older the layers and the </span> <span class="c0">pollen </span> <span
  class="c2 c0">were.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then they found
  something they didn't expect. The mud layers that were about 530 years old
  had a lot of corn pollen. At first the botanist didn't believe it. Why would
  corn pollen suddenly show up in the middle of a forest? Had native people
  lived on the shores of the lake? Had they cut down the trees and planted
  corn fields? The botanist went to an </span> <span class="c0">archaeologist
  </span> <span class="c2 c0">for help. </span></p><p class="c4"><span
  class="c0">How do you find the </span> <span class="c0">things left
  over</span> <span class="c0"> from a</span> <span class="c0"> village
  </span> <span class="c0">that disappeared long ago? If you're an
  archaeologist, you look for signs that people have somehow changed the land.
  You look for </span> <span class="c0">ridges </span> <span class="c0">or
  bumps or hollows. You watch for </span> <span class="c0">artifacts </span>
  <span class="c0">dug up by groundhogs or by a farmer's </span> <span
  class="c0">plough</span> <span class="c2 c0">. And you go to people who know
  the land better than you do—like farmers.</span></p><p class="c13"><span
  class="c0">It turned out that the farmer who had lived on the shores of
  Crawford Lake had collected a basketful of stone axes and </span> <span
  class="c0">arrowheads </span> <span class="c0">on his land. He'd found most
  of them in his barnyard. When archaeologists dug up the barnyard, they found
  pottery, food storage pits, stains from old </span> <span
  class="c0">firepits </span> <span class="c0">and marks in the earth from
  long house </span> <span class="c0">posts</span> <span class="c0">. And in
  the garbage pits, they found </span> <span class="c0">charred </span> <span
  class="c2 c0">kernels of corn! The botanist's guess was right. Native people
  had once lived on the shores of the lake. They had grown corn.</span>
