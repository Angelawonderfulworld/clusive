  class="c16"><span class="c3 c0">Crawford Lake is a small, deep lake west of
  Toronto. Lakes of this kind, called “meromictic lakes,” are found all over
  the world, but they are uncommon and of special interest to many scientists.
  Why?</span></p><figure><img

  can reveal clues to the past.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="c4"><span
  class="c0">In most lakes, all the water mixes together and </span> <span
  class="c0">churns </span> <span class="c0">up the mud on the bottom. In
  meromictic lakes, the water is so vastly deep that the mud on the bottom
  doesn't get disarranged. Things that fall into the lake sink to the bottom,
  pile up and stay there for thousands of years, forming layers that can be
  seen. Because of this layering, palaeobotanists (scientists who study
  </span> <span class="c0">fossilized </span> <span class="c3 c0">plants) can
  take samples of bottom mud and make discoveries about the plants that lived
  on the shores of the lake long ago.</span></p><p class="c4"><span
  class="c0">That's just what was happening at Crawford Lake in 1971. A
  palaeobotanist decided to collect a representative section of bottom mud in
  order to study the pollen </span> <span class="c0">grains</span> <span
  class="c0"> it possessed. By looking at the </span> <span
  class="c0">fossilized </span> <span class="c3 c0">pollen in the lake mud, he
  hoped to learn what plants had grown near the lake for hundreds of years and
  discover how those plants had changed over time.</span></p><p
  class="c4"><span class="c0">To collect bottom mud, the </span> <span
  class="c0">botanist </span> <span class="c0 c3">filled a heavy hollow tube
  with dry ice to make it freezing cold. He lowered this “frigid finger” into
  the lake and into the mud, and when he pulled it up ten minutes later, it
  was coated with a thin crust of frozen mud.</span></p><p class="c4"><span
  class="c0">Back at the lab, the botanist and his assistant studied the
  frozen crust. They could see layers, two for each year. The top two layers
  were from 1971. The further down they went, the older the layers and the
  </span> <span class="c0">pollen </span> <span
  class="c3 c0">were.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then they found
  something that they did not expect. The mud layers that were about 530 years
  old contained a great deal of corn pollen. Initially, the botanist didn't
  believe the findings. Why would corn pollen suddenly show up in the middle
  of a forest? Was it possible that native people had once lived on the shores
  of the lake, cut down the trees and planted corn fields? The botanist went
  to an </span> <span class="c0">archaeologist </span> <span class="c3 c0">for
  help. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">How do you find the remnants
  of a community that vanished centuries ago? If you're an archaeologist, you
  look for signs that people have somehow changed the land, changes that
  humans make, such as telltale </span> <span class="c0">ridges </span> <span
  class="c0">or bumps or hollows from where they have built or moved the dirt,
  rocks, or land. You watch for </span> <span class="c0">artifacts </span>
  <span class="c0">dug up by groundhogs or by a farmer's </span> <span
  class="c0">plough</span> <span class="c3 c0">. And you go to people who know
  the land better than you do, people such as farmers.</span></p><p
  class="c17"><span class="c0">It turned out that the farmer who had lived on
  the shores of Crawford Lake had collected a basketful of stone axes and
  </span> <span class="c0">arrowheads </span> <span class="c0">on his land,
  most of which he had found in his barnyard. Sure enough, when archaeologists
  dug up the barnyard, they found pottery, food storage pits, stains from old
  </span> <span class="c0">firepits </span> <span class="c0">and marks in the
  earth from long house </span> <span class="c0">posts</span> <span
  class="c0">. And in the garbage pits, they found </span> <span
  class="c0">charred </span> <span class="c3 c0">kernels of corn! The
  botanist's guess was right. Native people had once lived on the shores of
  the lake and had grown corn.</span> </p><hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text
