  <body><h1>Should There Be Amnesty for Undocumented Immigrants?</h1>

  the United States as a child, Marcos studied diligently while his parents
  worked long hours. Now he is a top student in his high school class.
  However, he may not be able to go to college; the government will not give
  him the same help it gives to other students. There are jobs that he will
  not be permitted to take, even though he could do the work, and he even will
  not be allowed to get his driver’s license. Marcos is an undocumented
  immigrant, an individual who came from another country and who does not have
  papers that prove he has the right to live in America. The laws and
  initiatives that help many people in America exclude Marcos, his family, and
  many others.</p> <p>Some people say Marcos’ family violated the law when
  they entered the country, and therefore they should not have the rights of
  immigrants who came to America legally. Others say it’s unfair that our laws
  exclude hard working people; they think America is a place where everyone
  should have equal rights. Some want the government to give undocumented
  immigrants amnesty, so that they can become legal. The U.S. passed a law
  like this once before. This previous law let immigrants who had been in
  America from 1982 to 1986 get legal records. Many assert that the U.S.
  should pass a new amnesty law to assist people like Marcos and his
  family.</p> <p>Other people say there should not be amnesty for undocumented
  immigrants. They say we should orient our immigration laws toward
  safeguarding those who went through the established channels, rather than
  those who “jumped the line.” As it is, they say, we don’t have enough jobs
  to go around, or enough money to pay for everyone’s education. Giving
  amnesty to undocumented immigrants will only compound the problem.</p>
  <p>What do you say? Should there be amnesty for undocumented immigrants?</p>
