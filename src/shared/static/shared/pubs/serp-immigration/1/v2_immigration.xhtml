  <body><h1>Should There Be Amnesty for Undocumented Immigrants?</h1>

  the United States as a child, Marcos studied hard while his parents worked
  long hours. Now he is a top student in his high school class. But he may not
  be able to go to college because the government won't give him the same help
  it gives to other students. There are jobs that he will not be allowed to
  take, even though he could do the work. And he won't be allowed to get his
  driver's license. Marcos is an undocumented immigrant, someone who doesn't
  have papers that prove he has the right to live in America. The laws and
  programs that help many people in America exclude Marcos and his family.</p>
  <p>Some people say Marcos’ family broke the law when they entered the
  country. Therefore they should not have the rights of legal immigrants.
  Others say it’s unfair that our laws exclude hard working people. They think
  America is a place where everyone should have equal rights. Some want the
  government to give undocumented immigrants amnesty, so that they can become
  legal. The U.S. passed a law like this once before. It let immigrants who
  had been in America from 1982 to 1986 get legal documents. Many argue that
  the U.S. should pass a new amnesty law to help people like Marcos and his
  family.</p> <p>Other people say there should not be amnesty for undocumented
  immigrants. They say we should orient our immigration laws toward protecting
  those who went through the proper channels, not those who “jumped the line.”
  As it is, they say, we don’t have enough jobs to go around, or enough money
  to pay for everyone’s education. Giving amnesty to undocumented immigrants
  will only compound the problem.</p> <p>What do you say? Should there be
  amnesty for undocumented immigrants?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text
