  <body><h1>Censorship: Who Should Decide What Young People Read?</h1>
  <figure><img alt="Photo of four students reading a newspaper."

  choice over what they read? </figcaption></figure> <p>Each year, people try
  to keep some books out of schools and libraries. These people think students
  should not have access to literature about things they think are improper
  for them. Many popular books have been forbidden in recent years. Books like
  To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee have been forbidden. The Giver by Lois
  Lowry and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison are said to be improper. Even
  Harry Potter has been forbidden. </p> <p>Some people think that youth should
  be protected from difficult issues. Racism or violence are bad for kids.
  These people also think that books can give kids bad ideas. Other people
  think that youth face tough issues in their lives already. Those issues
  should be integrated into meaningful stories. That way, young people might
  find books helpful for understanding their own lives. For example, when a
  novel includes a problem such as racism, it can help kids dealing with
  prejudice to feel less alone. It might also help them to see how their
  actions can affect other people.</p> <p>Librarians and teachers try to
  promote positive attitudes toward reading. They like to see students
  interested in literature. Some librarians and teachers want censored books
  to be accessible to students. These books are often the most interesting to
  read. Many American citizens argue that book banning and other types of
  censorship violate their civil rights.</p> <p>Should students have the
  freedom to read anything they choose despite the possible dangers?</p>
