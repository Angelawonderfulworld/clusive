  <body><h1>Censorship: Who Should Decide What Young People Read?</h1>
  <figure><img alt="Photo of four students reading a newspaper."

  choice over what they read? </figcaption></figure> <p>Each year, people try
  to keep specific books out of schools and libraries; they feel that students
  should not have access to literature about subjects they consider unseemly
  for young readers. Many popular books have been challenged or prohibited in
  recent years. The list includes To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, The
  Giver by Lois Lowry, and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. Even the
  fantastically popular series Harry Potter is on the list of prohibited.</p>
  <p>Some people think that youth should be shielded from challenging and
  disturbing issues, such as racism or violence. They also think that books
  can give kids unacceptable and inappropriate ideas. Other people suggest
  that youth are facing tough issues in their everyday lives already and, if
  those issues are integrated into meaningful stories, young people might find
  books helpful and relevant for understanding their own lives. For example,
  when a novel integrates a problem such as racism, it can help kids dealing
  with prejudice to feel less alone and it may also help kids to see how their
  actions can affect other people.</p> <p>Librarians and teachers try to
  promote positive attitudes toward reading. They like to see students fully
  engaged with relevant literature. Some librarians and teachers want censored
  books to be accessible to students because they are often interesting to
  read. Many American citizens argue that book banning and other types of
  censorship violate their civil rights.</p> <p>Should students have the
  freedom to read anything they choose despite the possible perils?</p> <hr />
