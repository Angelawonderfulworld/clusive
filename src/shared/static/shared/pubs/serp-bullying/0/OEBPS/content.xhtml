  prevent bullying?</h1><section><p><span>Kendra started at a new school in
  the seventh grade. During her first week, a group of girls started teasing
  her. Then more kids joined in. Now she gets called names every day. People
  push her in the hallways. They steal her backpack. They throw it in the
  trash. Kendra wants help. She is ashamed to tell her parents or her
  teachers. She feels like everything is her fault.</span></p><figure><img

  someone feel isolated, uncomfortable, or unwelcome can be a type of
  bullying.</figcaption></figure><p><span>Bullying is a problem in schools
  today. Boys and girls can be bullies or victims. Punching, teasing, and
  spreading untrue stories all constitute bullying. About half of all kids say
  they have been bullied at school. Many kids who are bullied feel bad about
  themselves. Some try to avoid school. Some even think about killing
  themselves.</span></p><p><span>It is important for schools to make sure
  everyone is treated the same. No one should be treated like they are less
  than anyone else. Many people believe that schools should pass rules to
  legislate an end to bullying. </span></p><p><span>However, all schools have
  rules against bullying. These laws generally do not resolve the problem.
  Maybe peer intervention constitutes the only resolution to bullying. Should
  kids step up when they see bullying incidents? Some researchers say that the
  people who look on and do nothing are as to blame as the
  bullies.</span></p><p><span>Many bystanders are afraid to step in. They fear
  they will be bullied. Also, many kids just don’t know what to do. They say
  it is easier to walk away. Instead of amending the rules about bullying,
  maybe schools should teach kids what to do when they see a bullying
  event. </span></p><p><span>Is it fair to blame people for not stepping in to
  resolve the bullying event? Should kids put themselves in danger to keep
  their classmates
  safe?</span></p><hr /><p><em><span>Credits:</span></em></p><div
