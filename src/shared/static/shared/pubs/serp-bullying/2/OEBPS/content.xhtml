  <body> <section> <h1 id="header-2"> Are kids responsible for stepping in to
  prevent bullying? </h1> <section> <p><span>Kendra started at a new school in
  the seventh grade when, during her first week, a group of girls started
  teasing her. Soon after, more kids joined in and now she gets called names
  every day. People push her in the hallways. They steal her backpack and
  throw it in the trash. Kendra wants help, but she is mortified to tell her
  parents or her teachers because she feels that she is to blame for
  everything that is happening.</span></p>

    <p><span>Bullying is a significant problem in
  schools today. Anyone, boys or girls, can be bullies or victims. Bullying
  can take many forms. Punching, teasing, and spreading hearsay all constitute
  bullying. About half of all kids say they have been bullied at some point
  during their time in school. Many kids who have experienced bullying have
  low self-esteem. Consequently, some try to avoid school, and some even think
  about killing themselves.</span></p><p><span>It is important for schools to
  promote equity and respect among all students. No one should be treated like
  they are less than anyone else. Therefore, many people believe that schools
  should be required to pass rules to legislate an end to
  bullying. </span></p><p><span>However, even though all schools have rules
  against bullying, these rules are generally ineffective and do not resolve
  the problem. Perhaps peer intervention constitutes the only resolution to
  bullying. Should kids step up when they see bullying incidents? Some
  researchers state that the onlookers who observe but do nothing about
  bullying incidents are as culpable as the bullies. </span></p><p><span>Many
  bystanders are afraid to intercede, fearing they themselves will be targeted
  by bullies. Furthermore, many kids just don’t know what to do and believe it
  is easier to just walk away. So rather than amending the rules about
  bullying, maybe schools should teach kids what actions they can take when
  they see a bullying occurrence. </span></p><p><span>Is it fair to blame
  bystanders for not intervening to resolve the bullying incident? Should kids
  put themselves in danger to protect their
  classmates?</span></p></section><section><hr /><p><em><span>Credits:</span></em></p><div
