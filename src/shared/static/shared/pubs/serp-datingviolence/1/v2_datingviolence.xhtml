  violence?</figcaption></figure> <p>In the hallway of Stevens High School,
  Franny and Jada, two seventh-grade girls, are leaning against their lockers
  reading a magazine. They read a horrible story about their favorite
  popsinging couple: Shelley and James. Jada reads aloud: “James became angry
  at Shelley. He hit her in the face, then punched and bit her repeatedly,
  threatened to kill her, and even choked her, over the course of 20 minutes.”
  At first, neither girl can believe that James, the beloved star, physically
  assaulted Shelley. “Maybe Shelley is lying,” Jada says. “Maybe Shelley
  wasn’t hurt that badly. Or maybe she did something that triggered the
  assault.” But when they see the photo of Shelley’s bruised, bloody face,
  they changed their minds.</p> <p>According to the Family Violence Prevention
  Fund, dating violence is a serious problem. One in three teenage girls is
  physically, emotionally, or verbally abused by a dating partner.</p>
  <p>Franny and Jada read on. The article says that when James was young, he
  saw his father beat his mother. His attitude toward women and violence may
  have become distorted by these experiences. But is this a good explanation?
  Does it excuse his behavior?</p> <p>Finally, the article says that Shelley
  eventually forgave James and dropped the charges. Franny and Jada are
  outraged. “Even if Shelley drops the charges, the police should make James
  pay,” says Franny. “He broke the law!” Franny’s and Jada’s friend, Kim,
  overhears their conversation. “No one really knows what went on between
  Shelley and James,” she says. “If Shelley wants him back, that’s her
  business.”</p> <p>What do you think? Should Shelley press charges, or is it
  her right to decide that James should be forgiven? Is dating violence a
  private matter, or a public one? How should we handle dating violence?</p>
