  violence?</figcaption></figure> <p>Franny and Jada, two seventh-grade girls,
  stand in the hallway of Stevens High School, leaning against their lockers
  perusing a magazine. They read a shocking story about their favorite pop
  singing twosome: Shelley and James. Jada reads the story aloud: “James
  became enraged at Shelley. He struck her in the face, then punched and bit
  her repeatedly, while he threatened to kill her. James even attempted to
  throttle Jada, and the terrible abuse lasted for over 20 minutes.” At first,
  the girls were astounded; neither girl can believe that James, the beloved
  star, could have physically assaulted Shelley. “Maybe Shelley is lying,”
  Jada says. “Maybe Shelley wasn’t injured that severely. Or maybe she
  precipitated the event; maybe she did something that triggered the assault.”
  However, when Franny and Jada see the photo of Shelley’s bruised and
  bloodied face, they changed their minds.</p> <p>According to the Family
  Violence Prevention Fund, dating violence is a significant problem. One in
  three teenage girls is physically, emotionally, or verbally abused by a
  dating partner.</p> <p>Franny and Jada continue to read further on in the
  article. The article says that when James was a youngster, he saw his father
  beat his mother. His perspective toward women and violence may have become
  distorted by these experiences. But is this an adequate explanation? Does it
  excuse his behavior?</p> <p>Finally, the article says that Shelley
  ultimately forgave James and dropped the charges she had filed against him.
  Franny and Jada are outraged. “Even if Shelley drops the charges, the police
  should make James pay,” says Franny. “He broke the law!” Franny’s and Jada’s
  friend, Kim, overhears their conversation. “No one really knows what went on
  between Shelley and James,” she says. “If Shelley wants him back, that’s her
  business.”</p> <p>What do you think? Should Shelley press charges, or is it
  her right to decide that James should be forgiven? Is dating violence a
  confidential matter, or a public one? How should we handle dating
  violence?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
