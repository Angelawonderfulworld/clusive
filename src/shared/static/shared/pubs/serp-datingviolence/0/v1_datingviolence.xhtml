  violence?</figcaption></figure> <p>In the hallway of Stevens High School,
  Franny and Jada, two seventh-grade girls, lean against their lockers. They
  are reading a magazine. They read a horrible story about their favorite pop
  singing pair: Shelley and James. Jada reads aloud: “James became angry at
  Shelley. He hit her in the face. Then he punched and bit her repeatedly. He
  threatened to kill her. He even choked her. He did this for over 20
  minutes.” At first, neither girl can believe that James physically assaulted
  Shelley. “Maybe Shelley is lying,” Jada says. “Maybe Shelley wasn’t hurt
  that badly. Or maybe she did something that triggered the assault.” When
  they see the photo of Shelley, they change their minds. Shelly’s face is
  bruised and bloody. </p> <p>According to the Family Violence Prevention
  Fund, dating violence is a significant problem. One in three teenage girls
  is physically, emotionally, or verbally abused by a dating partner.</p>
  <p>Franny and Jada read on. The article says that when James was young, he
  saw his father beat his mother. His opinion toward women and violence may
  have been distorted by these experiences. But is this a good explanation?
  Does it excuse his behavior?</p> <p>Finally, the article says that Shelley
  someday forgave James. She dropped the charges. Franny and Jada are
  outraged. “Even if Shelley drops the charges, the police should make James
  pay,” says Franny. “He broke the law!” Franny’s and Jada’s friend, Kim,
  overhears their conversation. “No one really knows what went on between
  Shelley and James,” she says. “If Shelley wants him back, that’s her
  business.”</p> <p>What do you think? Should Shelley press charges? Or is it
  her right to decide that James should be forgiven? Is dating violence a
  secret matter? Or is it a public one? How should we handle dating
  violence?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
