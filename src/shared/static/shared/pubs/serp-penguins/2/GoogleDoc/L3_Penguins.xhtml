  <body class="c12"><h1 id="header-1">Penguins are funny birds</h1><p
  class="c0"><span class="c2">Imagine being a crew member, hundreds of years
  ago, sailing in southern waters. Your captain is searching for food while
  exploring uncharted waters. Your job is to watch the sea off the ship's side
  for ice, guiding the pilot to avoid a wreck. White, floating ice in a
  dark-blue ocean stretches as far as you can see. The wind is cold on your
  face. Alongside the ship, a fish darts past. Another slows to a stop and
  raises its head above the water to look at you. How could a fish do that?
  </span> </p><figure><img alt="Photo of penguins on ice near open water."

  onto the snow and ice.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="c0"><span
  class="c2">Did the sailors see fish with feathers or swimming birds? Today,
  we know that the sailors saw birds that </span> <span class="c2">acquired
  </span> <span class="c2">the ability to swim. Their wings became </span>
  <span class="c2">flippers</span> <span class="c2">, and they could “fly”
  through the water with </span> <span class="c2">astonishing </span> <span
  class="c2">agility</span> <span class="c1">. </span> </p><p class="c0"><span
  class="c2">Sometimes, people joke that there are two types of penguins—the
  black ones walking away from you and the white ones walking toward you! In
  fact, there are 17 </span> <span class="c2">categories </span> <span
  class="c2">of penguins. Only two kinds raise their young on the </span>
  <span class="c2">continent </span> <span class="c1">of Antarctica. Adelie
  penguins grow to 29 inches tall and have a white ring around each eye.
  Emperor penguins have yellow-orange coloring near their necks. Standing
  about 35 inches tall, they are the tallest penguins living today. </span>
  </p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Emperor penguins have </span> <span
  class="c2">portable </span> <span class="c2">nests—the tops of their feet.
  Father Emperor penguins keep the egg on top of their feet for more than two
  months, nurturing the egg until it is ready to </span> <span
  class="c2">hatch</span> <span class="c1">. The mother penguin goes out for
  food during this time. Imagine holding an egg on your feet for two months
  until someone returns with the groceries!</span> </p><p class="c0"><span
  class="c2">Male and female penguins are both good parents. Once the chicks
  </span> <span class="c2">hatch</span> <span class="c2">, both parents travel
  long distances to find food for them in the sea. When chicks are big enough
  to be left alone, they gather and </span> <span class="c2">huddle </span>
  <span class="c2">together in a group, called a </span> <span
  class="c2">creche </span> <span class="c1">(pronounced “kresh”), to keep
  warm. There can be so many hatched checks that sometimes a creche contains
  more than 1,000 fluffy chicks.</span> </p><p class="c0"><span
  class="c2">Several days may pass before the parents return and the chicks
  eat again. When they return with food, the fun really begins because chicks
  will chase their parents around, begging for food. Penguin chicks eat huge
  amounts at one time, </span> <span class="c2">stockpiling </span> <span
  class="c1">so much food in their tummies that they look like sagging bags of
  laundry! </span> </p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, the adult
  penguins stop feeding the chicks, which is nature's way of forcing the
  children to grow up. When the penguin chicks are hungry enough, they find
  their way to the sea. Without any swimming lessons, they make their way into
  the icy waters, and they swim as only penguins do. </span></p> <hr />
