Your job is to watch the sea off the ship’s side for ice. You help the ship’s pilot to avoid a wreck. White, floating ice in a dark-blue ocean stretches as far as you can see. Cold wind blows on your face. A fish darts past, beside the ship. Another slows to a stop. It raises its head above the water to look at you. How could a fish do that?"
