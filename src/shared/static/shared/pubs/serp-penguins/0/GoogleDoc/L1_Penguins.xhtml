  class="c0 title" id="h.rfwj5rqe3nif"><span class="c3">Imagine being a crew
  member, hundreds of years ago. You are sailing in southern waters. Your
  captain is searching for food while exploring new waters. Your job is to
  watch the sea off the ship's side for ice. You help the ship's pilot to
  avoid a wreck. White, floating ice in a dark-blue ocean stretches as far as
  you can see. Cold wind blows on your face. A fish darts past, beside the
  ship. Another slows to a stop. It raises its head above the water to look at
  you. How could a fish do that?</span></p><figure><img

  <figcaption><p>A penguin "flies" out of the water onto the snow and
  ice.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Did the sailors
  see fish with feathers or swimming birds? Today, we know that the sailors
  saw birds that learned the ability to swim. Their wings became </span> <span
  class="c3">flippers. T</span><span class="c3">hey could “fly” through the
  water with surprising </span> <span class="c3">agility</span> <span
  class="c4 c3">. They were penguins.</span> </p><p class="c2"><span
  class="c3">Sometimes, people joke that there are two types of penguins—the
  black ones walking away from you and the white ones walking toward you! In
  fact, there are 17 kinds of penguins. Only two kinds raise their young on
  the </span> <span class="c3">continent </span> <span class="c4 c3">of
  Antarctica. Adelie penguins grow to 29 inches tall. Adelie penguins have a
  white ring around each eye. Emperor penguins have yellow-orange coloring
  near their necks. At about 35 inches tall, Emperor penguins are the tallest
  penguins living today. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Emperor
  penguins have </span> <span class="c3">portable </span> <span
  class="c3">nests—the tops of their feet. Father Emperor penguins keep the
  egg on top of their feet for more than two months, until the egg is ready to
  </span> <span class="c3">hatch</span> <span class="c4 c3">. The mother
  penguin goes out for food during this time. Imagine holding an egg on your
  feet for two months until someone returns with the groceries!</span> </p><p
  class="c2"><span class="c3">Male and female penguins are both good parents.
  Once the chicks </span> <span class="c3">hatch</span> <span class="c3">,
  both parents find food for them. They travel long distances to get food from
  the sea. When chicks are big enough, they are left alone. They </span> <span
  class="c3">huddle </span> <span class="c3">together in a group, called a
  </span> <span class="c3">creche </span> <span class="c4 c3">(pronounced
  “kresh”), to keep warm. Sometimes, a creche contains more than 1,000 fluffy
  chicks.</span> </p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c3">It may be days before
  the parents return and the chicks eat again. When parents return with food,
  the fun really begins. Chicks chase their parents, begging for food. Penguin
  chicks eat huge amounts at one time, keeping so much food in their tummies
  that they look like sagging bags of laundry! </span> </p><p class="c2"><span
  class="c4 c3">Eventually, the adult penguins stop feeding the chicks. This
  is nature’s way of forcing the children to grow up. When the penguin chicks
  are hungry enough, they find their way to the sea. Without any swimming
  lessons, they make their way into the icy waters, and they swim as only
  penguins do. </span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
