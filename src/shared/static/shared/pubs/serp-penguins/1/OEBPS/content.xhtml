  </h1><p><span>Imagine being a crew member, hundreds of years ago, sailing in
  southern waters. Your captain is searching for food while exploring
  unfamiliar waters. Your job is to watch the sea off the ship's side for ice,
  guiding the pilot to avoid a wreck. White, floating ice in a dark-blue ocean
  stretches as far as you can see. The wind is cold on your face. Alongside
  the ship, a fish darts past. Another slows to a stop and raises its head
  above the water to look at you. How could a fish do that?</span></p><figure>

  fish with feathers or swimming birds? Today, we know that the sailors saw
  birds that developed the ability to swim. Their wings became flippers, and
  they could “fly” through the water with amazing
  agility.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes, people joke that there are two types
  of penguins—the black ones walking away from you and the white ones walking
  toward you! In fact, there are 17 types of penguins. Only two kinds raise
  their young on the continent of Antarctica. Adelie penguins grow to 29
  inches tall and have a white ring around each eye. Emperor penguins have
  yellow-orange coloring near their necks. Standing about 35 inches tall, they
  are the tallest penguins living today.</span></p><p><span>Emperor penguins
  have portable nests—the tops of their feet. Father Emperor penguins keep the
  egg on top of their feet for more than two months, until the egg is ready to
  hatch. The mother penguin goes out for food during this time. Imagine
  holding an egg on your feet for two months until someone returns with the
  groceries!</span></p><p><span>Male and female penguins are both good
  parents. Once the chicks hatch, both parents travel long distances to find
  food for them in the sea. When chicks are big enough to be left alone, they
  huddle together in a group, called a creche (pronounced “kresh”), to keep
  warm. Sometimes, a creche contains more than 1,000 fluffy
  chicks.</span></p><p><span>It may be days before the parents return and the
  chicks eat again. When they return with food, the fun really begins. Chicks
  chase their parents, begging for food. Penguin chicks eat huge amounts at
  one time, storing so much food in their tummies that they look like sagging
  bags of laundry!</span></p><p><span>Eventually, the adult penguins stop
  feeding the chicks. This is nature’s way of forcing the children to grow up.
  When the penguin chicks are hungry enough, they find their way to the sea.
  Without any swimming lessons, they make their way into the icy waters, and
  they swim as only penguins do.</span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p> <i>Text
