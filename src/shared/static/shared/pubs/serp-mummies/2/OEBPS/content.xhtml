  <body> <section> <h1 id="header-2">Mummies: Who owns the dead?
  </h1><section><p><span>Mummies are very old dead human bodies that have been
  preserved with hair, flesh, and often clothing still on their bones. Some
  civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, have a tradition of making
  mummies when people die. Ancient Egyptians preserved the bodies of dead
  kings and queens because they believed this would confirm a good afterlife
  for these monarchs, which they believed were gods
  themselves.</span></p><figure><img

  human body.</figcaption></figure><p><span>In recent years, mummies that were
  created naturally have been discovered all over the world. One, found in the
  Alps and who appears to have died and been eventually frozen in a glacier,
  is known as the Iceman. The Iceman is presumed by scientists to be over
  5,000 years old!</span></p><p><span>There is a diversity of perspectives
  about what to do with mummies when they are discovered. Should they be
  removed and examined, or should they be left where they are? Many people
  believe that removing a mummy from its burial place debases the dead. They
  argue that mummies preserved by humans were honored by their culture for
  religious or other reasons, and that we should respect these rituals instead
  of damaging the burial ground and removing the dead. Some people argue that
  even mummies that were created naturally, like the Iceman, should not be
  disturbed after death out of respect for these humans from the distant
  past.</span></p><p><span>In contrast, others disagree and say that it would
  be injudicious to give up the opportunity to learn about ancient
  civilizations through the study of mummies. These people assert that
  humanity can discover a great deal about human history by studying these
  ancient human bodies. These artifacts can reveal clues about what people
  ate, the tools they created and used, what they wore, and how they lived and
  died. They can also help to enhance archaeologistsâ€™ understanding of human
  migration patterns. For example, scientific tests have revealed information
  about where the Iceman might have traveled in his
  lifetime.</span></p><p><span>Even among people who agree that we should
  remove and study mummies, there is a range of opinions about where the
  bodies should be studied or taken. Some think that each mummy belongs to the
  country where it was first discovered. They believe that researchers in its
  home country have the right to take ownership of the
  mummy.</span></p><p><span>Others believe that each mummy should go to the
  museum or university best equipped to study and protect it, even if it will
  need to be conveyed to a different country. They argue that the home country
  will not always have the ability to properly remove, transport, study, and
  store the mummy. If it isn't handled carefully, a mummy will deteriorate and
  will no longer be useful for scientific knowledge at
  all.</span></p><p><span>What do you think?</span></p></section> <hr />
