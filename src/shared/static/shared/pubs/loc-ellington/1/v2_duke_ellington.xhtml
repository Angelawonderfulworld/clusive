  <p><strong>Born: </strong>April 29, 1899, Washington, D.C.</p>
  <p><strong>Died: </strong>May 24, 1974, New York City</p> <p>Born Edward
  Kennedy Ellington, Duke Ellington was one of the founding fathers of jazz
  music. He started playing piano at the age of seven, and by the time he was
  15, he was composing. A pianist, bandleader, arranger, and composer,
  Ellington and his band played together for 50 years. Some of Ellington's
  most famous songs include "Don't Get Around Much Anymore," "Sophisticated
  Lady" and "In a Sentimental Mood."</p> 
  <h3>Duke Ellington's Early Years</h3> <figure><img alt="Sheet music cover"
  src="images/03_ellington_rosary.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 3: Front cover of
  "The Rosary" sheet music from 1903. </figcaption></figure> <p>Duke Ellington
  was born in Washington D.C., and from an early age he loved music. When he
  was four years old, he listened to his mother play a popular piano tune
  called "The Rosary" and he cried, saying, "It was so pretty. So pretty." Not
  long after that, at the age of seven, he began to play piano himself. It
  seems that he knew he was going to go places. He told his next door
  neighbor, Mr. Pinn, "One of these days I'm going to be famous." How old do
  you think Duke Ellington was when he started writing music?</p>  <figure><img

  a soda fountain like this one inspired "Soda Fountain Rag."
  </figcaption></figure> <p>At age 15, Ellington worked at a soda fountain and
  wrote his first song, "Soda Fountain Rag." By his late teens, he was making
  enough money to help his parents move into a better house. One of
  Ellington's first professional gigs was a party where he played so long that
  his hand bled. He earned 75 cents. "It was the most money I had ever seen,"
  he said. "I rushed all the way home to my mother with it. But I could not
  touch a piano key for weeks . . . " What do you think was Ellington's next
  move?</p>  <figure><img

  Johnson was a friend and mentor of Duke Ellington </figcaption></figure>
  <p>Ellington studied music during the ragtime era. Ragtime was a kind of
  popular American music consisting of off-beat dance rhythms that began with
  the honky-tonk pianists along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. By the
  time he was 20, he and his friends formed a band that would be the
  foundation for his life's work. From 1923 to 1927, he and his band lived in
  New York City and made about 60 recordings. Their first big break came on
  December 4, 1927, at the opening night of what would turn out to be a long
  engagement at the Cotton Club in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. The
  Ellington Orchestra often broadcast live on radio from the Cotton Club, so
  their unique style of jazz became familiar to people across the country.</p>
   <h3>Duke's Band</h3> <figure><img

  group on the cover of Down Beat Magazine, 1946. </figcaption></figure>
  <p>Duke Ellington wrote music night and day. Although he was a pianist, it
  was said that his real instrument was his band and the gifted musicians with
  whom he worked. His drummer, Sonny Greer, was with the band from the
  beginning; second trombonist Juan Tizol was a Puerto Rican musician who
  added a little Latin influence to the band; trombonist Lawrence Brown joined
  the band in 1932 and stayed for 19 years; and Ray Nance played both the
  violin and trumpet. Mary Lou Williams, one of the great women in jazz,
  arranged music for Ellington.</p> 
  <figure><img alt="Billy Strayhorn"
  src="images/07_ellington_strayhorn.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 7: Billy
  Strayhorn collaborated with Ellington on some famous
  songs.</figcaption></figure> <p>Ellington may not have needed help writing
  music, but his partnership with Billy Strayhorn is considered one of the
  most important in American music. Strayhorn, who joined the band in 1939,
  composed and co-wrote some of the most famous pieces associated with
  Ellington, including the band's theme song, "Take the 'A' Train." Their
  partnership worked so smoothly that they were even able to write songs over
  the telephone. In his autobiography, Music Is My Mistress, Ellington refers
  to Strayhorn as "...my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of
  my head, my brainwaves in his head, and his in mine."</p>  <figure><img
  alt="Ellington performing with his orchestra"
  src="images/08_ellington_performs.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 8: Ellington
  performing with his orchestra.</figcaption></figure> <p>The Duke Ellington
  Orchestra was on the road for 50 years and kept up an incredible schedule.
  The band often performed two shows a day and sometimes even added in a
  recording session. Ellington's music was familiar to people in the U.S. and
  abroad--no place was too small or too grand for "the Duke," as he was known,
  to play. Over the years Ellington worked with many famous people, including
  Irving Berlin, Florenz Ziegfeld, Al Jolson, Lena Horn, Ella Fitzgerald, Max
  Roach, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Bing Crosby, and many
  more. Ellington and his band kept up their fast-paced touring schedule into
  the early 1970s.</p>  <h3>Duke
  Ellington's Varied Career</h3> <figure><img alt="Ellington and friends"
  src="images/09_ellington_friends.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 9: Ellington and
  friends. </figcaption></figure> <p>Referred to fondly as Maestro, Ellington
  loved writing music for his band. The tunes he composed gave each member a
  chance to shine. He also wrote an incredible amount of music for a number of
  different types of projects. He composed for musical reviews, movies,
  Broadway productions, and more. What other kind of music do you think
  Ellington wrote?</p>  <figure><img
  alt="portrait of Alvin Ailey"
  src="images/10_ellington_ailey.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 10: Portrait of
  Alvin Ailey in 1955.</figcaption></figure> <p>In 1970, the American Ballet
  Theater commissioned Ellington to develop a ballet, which he called The
  River. The ballet was choreographed by the famous dancer Alvin Ailey and
  premiered on June 25, 1970, at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.
  That same year, he was also commissioned to write a comic opera. Other works
  he wrote include a theater piece called Jump for Joy and music for films,
  including Cabin in the Sky and Black and Tan Fantasy. He and his co-writer,
  Billy Strayhorn, also composed the entire score for the film Anatomy of a
  Murder. What could top this?</p> 
  <figure><img alt="Ellington playing the piano"
  src="images/11_ellington_ivories.jpg" /><figcaption>Image 11: Ellington
  playing the piano. </figcaption></figure> <p>Ellington said that by the time
  he was 20 he had read the Bible three times. It's no surprise, then, that he
  wrote the Sacred Concerts, a three-part series of concerts combining
  classical European and African American forms and styles. The First Sacred
  Concert premiered at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco in 1965, the Second at
  the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, and the Third Sacred
  Concert at Westminster Abbey in London. When asked why it took so long to
  write the concerts, he said, "You can jive with secular music, but you can't
  jive with the Almighty." Duke Ellington certainly knew how to jive and with
  his music he taught the world how to swing along.</p> <hr /> <p>Text
