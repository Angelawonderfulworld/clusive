  going to school? </figcaption></figure> <p>Why do people attend educational
  institutions? Some individuals think the principal goal of education is
  imparting knowledge to students; they feel there is precise information that
  all individuals in school should acquire. For instance, they want kids to be
  aware of what happened in the Revolutionary War, or the mechanisms involved
  in food chains, or other essential information. Others interpret the main
  role of school as one of preparing students to get a good job and earn a
  living. They are most perturbed about students needing to learn particular
  skills and competencies, including reading, writing, and arithmetic; skills
  that are core for joining the workforce. </p> <p>Some individuals argue that
  schools should introduce a set of shared values, including liberty and
  justice. They believe this will help students understand the structure of
  our democratic government. For example, they feel it is essential for
  students to understand that while each of the three branches of government
  has a unique function, the three combine to work together to make sure we
  all enjoy certain freedoms and live by the same rules. </p> <p>Some think
  schools should educate students to analytically think and analyze what they
  see, hear, and read. They want students to be able to carefully consider
  different perspectives, to respect and challenge other viewpoints, and to
  formulate their own opinions about issues that affect them. Although many
  people say that they want kids to be able to think for themselves, students
  do not always have the freedom to do so in contemporary classrooms.</p>
  <p>What do you think the function of school is? What do you consider the
  most important factors in providing a good education? Which ingredients are
  crucial in your recipe for a good school?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
