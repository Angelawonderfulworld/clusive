  <body><h1>Is an Extended School Day the Right Choice for Middle School
  Students?</h1> <figure><img

  students learn better?</figcaption></figure> <p>Marisa Green knew sixth
  grade was not going to be easy. On the first day of class, Principal Hedges
  told the students of a radical change. The school day was going to be
  extended. School would go until 5:00. Students would even have to come to
  classes on some Saturdays.</p> <p>Principal Hedges said that other countries
  such as Germany, Singapore and Japan have up to 280 days in a school year.
  Most American students attend school only 180 days a year. Test scores
  suggest that 180 days may not be enough. In 2006, fifteen-year-olds from the
  U.S. scored lower on an international math test than students in 23 other
  developed countries. Principal Hedges said U.S. schools need to improve if
  Americans want to compete in the world economy.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Developed Countries</h3> <p>Developed
  countries are countries that have strong world economies and advanced
  technology. Their citizens are often educated through high school and
  college. These countries produce goods and services for other nations around
  the world.</p> </aside> <p>The late Senator Edward Kennedy also supported
  extending the school day. He proposed an initiative that is being tested
  now. Some schools have added two extra hours to every school day. In some
  schools, students spend the extra time on Mondays through Thursdays focusing
  on learning school subjects. On Fridays, the extra hours are for things like
  art or music. People who want a longer school day believe it is crucial.
  It’s especially important for students who need extra time to attain
  grade-level reading and math skills.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Public Education</h3> <p>In the United States,
  government leaders and citizens have long believed that public education
  helps people learn important information and skills in order to succeed in
  society. The more educated people are, the more successful they will be. And
  the more successful people are, the more successful the country will be. In
  1827, Massachusetts passed a law making all grades of public school open to
  all students free of charge. Other states followed Massachusetts’ example,
  and public education from elementary to high school became a free service
  the government offered its citizens.</p> </aside> <p>Some people think
  extending the school day is not enough. They say that just adding hours will
  not make a difference to student attainment in reading, math, and science.
  They point out that teachers will need more time to prepare lessons for the
  extended day. Teachers may need more materials for the lessons. Also,
  extended days do not assure that the teachers are teaching subjects they
  know best. For example, some schools don’t have enough math teachers. In
  those schools, English teachers may have to teach material they do not know.
  Many people argue that we need to focus on improving school excellence,
  rather than just extending the day.</p> <p>What is your opinion? Should
  schools extend the school day to improve student learning attainment?</p>
