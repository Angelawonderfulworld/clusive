  <body><h1>Is an Extended School Day the Right Choice for Middle School
  Students?</h1> <figure><img

  students learn better?</figcaption></figure> <p>Marisa Green knew sixth
  grade was not going to be easy. On the first day of class, Principal Hedges
  told the students of a radical change to their schedule. The school day was
  going to be extended until 5:00. Students would even have to attend classes
  on some Saturdays.</p> <p>Principal Hedges explained that other countries
  such as Germany, Singapore and Japan have up to 280 days in a school year.
  Most American students attend school only 180 days a year. Test scores
  suggest that 180 days may not be enough. In 2006, fifteen-year-olds from the
  U.S. scored lower on an international math test than students in 23 other
  developed countries. Principal Hedges said U.S. schools need to improve if
  Americans want to compete in the global economy.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Developed Countries</h3> <p>Developed
  countries are countries that have strong global economies and advanced
  technology. Their citizens are often educated through high school and
  college. These countries produce goods and services for other nations around
  the world.</p> </aside> <p>The late Senator Edward Kennedy also supported
  extending the school day. He proposed an initiative that is being tested in
  Massachusetts. Schools that are part of this initiative have added two extra
  hours to every school day. In some schools, students spend the extra time on
  Mondays through Thursdays focusing on academics. They use the extra hours on
  Fridays for enrichment activities, such as art or music. People who support
  an extended school day believe it is crucial for students who need extra
  time to attain grade-level reading and math skills.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Public Education</h3> <p>In the United States,
  government leaders and citizens have long believed that public education
  helps people learn important information and skills in order to succeed in
  society. The more educated people are, the more successful they will be. And
  the more successful people are, the more successful the country will be. In
  1827, Massachusetts passed a law making all grades of public school open to
  all students free of charge. Other states followed Massachusettsâ€™ example,
  and public education from elementary to high school became a free service
  the government offered its citizens.</p> </aside> <p>Some people think
  extending the school day is insufficient to improve student achievement.
  They argue that just adding hours will not make a difference to student
  attainment in reading, math, and science. They point out that teachers will
  need more time to prepare lessons for the extended day. Teachers may need
  more materials for the lessons as well. Also, extended days do not guarantee
  that the teachers who are hired to teach are teaching subjects they know
  best. For example, some schools don't have enough math teachers. In those
  schools, English teachers may have to teach material they have not been
  trained to teach. Many people argue that we need to focus on improving
  school quality, rather than just extending the day.</p> <p>What is your
  opinion? Should schools extend the school day to improve student academic
  attainment?</p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
