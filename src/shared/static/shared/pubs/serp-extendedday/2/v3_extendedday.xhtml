  <body><h1>Is an Extended School Day the Right Choice for Middle School
  Students?</h1> <figure><img

  students learn better?</figcaption></figure> <p>Marisa Green knew sixth
  grade was not going to be easy. On the first day of class, Principal Hedges
  informed the students of a radical change to their schedule. The school day
  was going to be extended until 5:00. Students would even be required to
  attend classes on selected Saturdays.</p> <p>Principal Hedges explained
  that, internationally, other countries such as Germany, Singapore and Japan
  have up to 280 days in a school year. Most American students attend school
  merely 180 days a year, and American test scores suggest that 180 days may
  not be enough. In 2006, fifteen-year-olds from the U.S. scored lower on an
  international math test than students in 23 other developed countries.
  Principal Hedges said that, if Americans want to compete in the
  international economy U.S. schools need to improve.</p> <aside> <h3
  class="article-sidebar-title">Developed Countries</h3> <p>Developed
  countries are countries that have strong international economies and
  advanced technology. Their citizens are often educated through high school
  and college. These countries produce goods and services for other nations
  around the world.</p> </aside> <p>The late Senator Edward Kennedy also
  supported extending the school day. He proposed an initiative that is being
  tested in Massachusetts. Schools that are part of this initiative have added
  two extra hours to every school day. In some schools, students spend the
  extra time on Mondays through Thursdays focusing on scholastics. They use
  the extra hours on Fridays for enrichment and extracurricular activities,
  such as art or music. People who support an extended school day believe it
  is crucial for students who need extra time to attain grade-level reading
  and math skills.</p> <aside> <h3 class="article-sidebar-title">Public
  Education</h3> <p>In the United States, government leaders and citizens have
  long believed that public education helps people learn important information
  and skills in order to succeed in society. The more educated people are, the
  more successful they will be. And the more successful people are, the more
  successful the country will be. In 1827, Massachusetts passed a law making
  all grades of public school open to all students free of charge. Other
  states followed Massachusetts’ example, and thus public education from
  elementary to high school became a free service the government offered its
  citizens.</p> </aside> <p>Some individuals think extending the school day is
  a measure that will be inadequate to improve student achievement. They
  contend that just adding hours will not make a difference to student growth
  and attainment in reading, math, and science. They point out that teachers
  will need more time to prepare lessons for the extended day, and, moreover,
  that teachers may need more materials for the lessons as well. Likewise,
  extended days do not certify that the teachers who are hired to teach are
  teaching subjects they know best. For example, some schools don’t have
  enough math teachers and, in those schools, English teachers may have to
  teach material they have not been trained or are unqualified to teach. Many
  people argue that we need to focus on improving school caliber, rather than
  just extending the day.</p> <p>What is your opinion? Should schools extend
  the school day to improve student scholastic attainment?</p> <hr />
