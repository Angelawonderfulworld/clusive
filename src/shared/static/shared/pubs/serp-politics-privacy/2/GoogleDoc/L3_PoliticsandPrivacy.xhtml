  class="c5">Politics and Privacy: What do we need to know about a
  candidate?</span> </h1><p class="c9"><span>Sam Ellis was a strong supporter
  of one candidate for President. He agreed with all her stances on the
  issues. He planned to vote for her in the election. Then, one morning, Sam
  read in the newspaper that his candidate had once been caught with
  marijuana, back when the candidate was in high school, over 25 years
  earlier. Sam was dismayed and now wondered if this political candidate still
  deserved his vote.</span> </p><figure><img

  to know about its leaders?</p></figcaption></figure><p
  class="c4"><span>During </span> <span>campaigns</span><span>, we learn a lot
  about political candidates. Some of this information is unsavory. Some
  candidates for political office have</span> <span>abused</span>
  <span>alcohol or drugs, some have cheated on their</span>
  <span>spouses</span> <span>or stolen money. Does the public have a right to
  know the personal details about political candidates? Some people say yes.
  They point out that a candidate is asking for the publicâ€™s trust and ask how
  we, the public, can understand a candidate's</span> <span>ethics</span>
  <span>if we don't know the details about his or her personal life.</span>
  </p><p class="c4"><span>Others think that if we</span>
  <span>ostracized</span> <span>everyone who ever made a mistake, we could
  very well leave out people who would make good leaders. Some people think we
  should only focus on how candidates will handle</span> <span>pivotal </span>
  <span>issues</span> <span>like terrorism, education, and global warming, not
  how they handle their marriage or their private mistakes. Should some parts
  of a candidate's personal life be off-limits to the press and to the
  public?</span> </p><p class="c14"><span>Imagine this: One of your friends
  posts a photograph of you being a clown and doing something very
  embarrassing at a party (use your imagination). If one day you decided to
  run for public office, you could be sure that this photo would be</span>
  <span>displayed</span> <span>in newspapers, on television, and all over the
  internet. One funny moment from years earlier would follow you into your
  future and ruin a potentially successful career. Would you feel like your
  privacy had been</span> <span>assailed</span><span class="c2">? Or would you
  believe that the public has the right to know about your teenage
  behavior?</span> </p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
