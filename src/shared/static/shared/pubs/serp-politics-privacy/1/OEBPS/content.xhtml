  <body><section> <h1 id="header-1"> Politics and Privacy </h1><p><span>Sam
  Ellis was a strong supporter of one candidate for President. He agreed with
  all of her positions. He planned to vote for her in the election. Then, one
  morning, Sam read in the newspaper that his candidate had once been caught
  with marijuana. This had happened back when the candidate was in high
  school, over 25 years earlier. Sam was disappointed.</span></p><p><span>He
  wondered if she still deserved his vote.</span></p><figure><img

  to know about its leaders?</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>During
  campaigns, we learn a lot about political candidates. Some have abused
  alcohol or drugs. Some have cheated on their spouses or stolen money. Do we
  have a right to know personal details about political candidates? Some
  people say yes. They point out that a candidate is asking for the publicâ€™s
  trust. They ask how we, the public, can understand a candidate's ethics if
  we don't know about his or her personal life.</span></p><p><span>Others
  think that if we exclude everyone who ever made a mistake, we might leave
  out people who would make good leaders. Some people think we should only
  focus on how candidates will handle crucial issues like terrorism,
  education, and global warming, not how they handle their marriage or their
  private mistakes. Should some parts of a candidate's personal life be
  off-limits?</span></p><p><span>Imagine this: One of your friends posted a
  photograph of you being a clown and doing something very embarrassing at a
  party (use your imagination). If one day you decided to run for public
  office, you could be sure that this photo would be displayed in newspapers,
  on television, and all over the internet. One funny moment from years
  earlier would follow you into your future. Would you feel like your privacy
  had been invaded? Or would you believe that the public has the right to know
  about your teenage behavior?</span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p> <i>Text
