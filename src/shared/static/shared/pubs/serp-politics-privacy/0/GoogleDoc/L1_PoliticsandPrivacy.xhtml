  class="c6">Politics and Privacy: What do we need to know about a
  candidate?</span> </h1><p class="c17"><span>Sam Ellis was a supporter of one
  </span> <span>candidate</span> <span>for President. He agreed with all her
  </span> <span>ideas</span><span>. He planned to vote for her in the
  election. Then, one morning, Sam read in the newspaper that his candidate
  had once been caught with marijuana. This had happened 25 years earlier. The
  candidate was in high school. Sam was </span> <span>upset</span> <span>. He
  wondered if she still deserved his vote.</span> </p><figure><img

  to know about its leaders?</p></figcaption></figure><p
  class="c9"><span>During </span> <span>campaigns</span><span>, we learn a lot
  about political candidates. Some have </span> <span>abused
  </span><span>alcohol. Some have used drugs. Some have cheated on
  their</span> <span>spouses.</span> <span>Some have stolen money. Do we have
  a right to know personal details about political candidates? Some people say
  yes. A candidate is asking for the public's trust. How we, the public,
  understand a candidate's</span> <span>ethics </span><span>if we don't know
  about his or her personal life.</span> </p><p class="c9"><span>Others think
  that we cannot </span> <span>keep out </span> <span>everyone who ever made a
  mistake. If we do, we will leave out people who would be good leaders. Some
  people think we should focus on how candidates will handle </span>
  <span>important </span> <span>issues</span><span>. Issues like terrorism,
  education, and global warming. We should not focus on their marriage or
  private mistakes. What do you think? Should some parts of a candidate's
  personal life be off-limits?</span> </p><p class="c9"><span>Imagine this: A
  friend posts a picture of you being a clown and doing something very
  embarrassing at a party (use your imagination). If one day you decide to run
  for public office, this picture would be </span> <span>displayed</span>
  <span>in newspapers, on television, and on the internet. One funny moment
  from years earlier follows you into your future. Would you feel like your
  privacy had been </span> <span>attacked</span><span class="c1">? Or would
  you believe that the public has the right to know about your teenage
  behavior?</span></p> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p> <p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
