  <body> <section> <h1 id="header-2"> Who is responsible for doping in
  professional team sports? </h1><section><p><span>Why do so many well-known
  athletes use drugs to help them play better? People accuse baseball players
  like Manuel “Manny” Ramírez, Roger Clemens, and Alex Rodriguez of using
  steroids. People also accuse players of using outlawed drugs (“doping”).
  They use these to help their athletic performance. Ramírez retired in 2011.
  He left baseball to avoid a 100-game suspension after he tested positive for
  performance-enhancing drugs. It was the third time testing positive for
  drugs in his career.</span></p><figure><img

  Rodriguez, a slugger for the New York Yankees, was suspended for the 2014
  baseball season. He had used prohibited performance-enhancing drugs.
  Rodriguez denied the use of chemical compounds. Even though he denies using
  drugs, he has been disgraced and people still doubt
  him. </span></p><p><span>Steroids are illegal for athletes to use. They are
  easily found through blood tests. Now athletes are substituting new ways of
  cheating. These new ways are harder to find.  For example, cyclists and
  other endurance athletes give themselves blood transfusions. This changes
  the amount of oxygen in their blood.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the cyclist
  Lance Armstrong admitted to doping. Doping helped Armstrong win many titles
  and trophies. It helped him get a lot of money and endorsement deals.
  Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times. After evidence surfaced of his
  use of illegal compounds, the United States Anti-Doping Agency took his
  titles away. The U.S. Postal Service is even suing Armstrong for fraud. They
  gave millions of dollars to help him and his team. They felt cheated,
  too.</span></p><p><span>Some people say that athletes should not be blamed
  for doing doping. Sports writers point out that athletes are pressured to
  perform and do better than competitors. That makes steroid use tempting.
  Fans and sponsors push for more power hitting, faster times, and bigger
  championships. If they did not, maybe athletes wouldn't be so likely to
  alter their bodies with dangerous
  drugs.  </span></p><p><span> </span><span>Many athletes are conflicted about
  using these drugs. Drugs hurt athletes’ health. Athletes using steroids know
  the negative costs. Men's breasts grow and their testicles shrink. They may
  get acne. Many users experience confusion or feelings of anger, known as
  “roid rage.”</span></p><p><span>Some fundamental questions that should be
  asked are: Who is responsible for making illegal substances part of team
  sports? Would athletes alter their blood and body chemistry if they didn't
  feel so much pressure to outperform their peers? Should fans and sponsors
  bear some of the responsibility?</span></p></section> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
