  <body><section><h1 id="header-2"> Who is responsible for doping in
  professional team sports? </h1><section><p><span>Why do so many well-known
  athletes use performance-enhancing drugs in contemporary times? Baseball
  players like Manuel “Manny” Ramírez, Roger Clemens, and Alex Rodriguez have
  all been accused of using steroids or prohibited drugs (“doping”) to amplify
  their athletic performance. Ramírez retired in 2011 in order to circumvent a
  100-game suspension from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays after he tested positive
  for performance-enhancing substances for the third time in his career. Alex
  Rodriguez, a slugger for the New York Yankees, was suspended for the 2014
  baseball season after it was discovered that he used prohibited
  performance-enhancing drugs. In spite of the fact that Rodriguez denied the
  use of chemical compounds, he has been disgraced and his record remains
  under scrutiny.</span></p><figure><img

  schemes.</figcaption></figure><p><span>Because steroids have been declared
  illegal and are now easily identifiable, athletes have started substituting
  new techniques to obtain unfair advantages that are even more challenging to
  detect. For example, cyclists and other endurance athletes administer blood
  transfusions to themselves in order to alter the oxygenation of their
  blood.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the cyclist Lance Armstrong finally
  acknowledged that he was using illegal techniques and substances to win his
  numerous titles and trophies, which had earned him enormous earnings and
  endorsement deals. Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times, but after
  compelling evidence surfaced of his use of clandestine compounds, the United
  States Anti-Doping Agency stripped him of his titles in 2012. The U.S.
  Postal Service is even suing Armstrong for fraud because the USPS had paid
  millions of dollars to subsidize Armstrong and his entire
  team. </span></p><p><span>Some commentators argue that athletes should not
  be blamed for partake in using illicit drugs and techniques to get a
  competitive advantage. Sports writers point out that athletes are so
  pressured to continuously perform and outdo competitors that steroid use is
  very tempting. If fans and sponsors didn't push for more power hitting,
  faster times, and bigger championships, they argue, maybe athletes would be
  less inclined to alter their bodies with potentially dangerous
  drugs.</span></p><p><span>Many athletes are conflicted about using these
  chemical compounds, which take a toll on their mental and physical health.
  Those using steroids are conscious of the negative consequences; men's
  breasts grow, and their testicles shrink, they may get acne, and many users
  experience delusions or feelings of belligerence, known as “roid
  rage.”</span></p><p><span>Some fundamental questions that perhaps should be
  asked are: Who is responsible for making illegal substances part of team
  sports? Would athletes alter their blood and body chemistry if they didn't
  feel so much pressure to outperform their peers? Should fans and sponsors
  bear some of the responsibility?</span></p></section> <hr /> <p>Credits:</p>
