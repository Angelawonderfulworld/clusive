            <p><span>Why do so many well-known athletes use performance-enhancing drugs in contemporary times? Baseball players like Manuel “Manny” Ramírez, Roger Clemens, and Alex Rodriguez have all been accused of using steroids or prohibited drugs (“doping”) to amplify their athletic performance. Ramírez retired in 2011 in order to circumvent a 100-game suspension from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays after he tested positive for performance-enhancing substances for the third time in his career. Alex Rodriguez, a slugger for the New York Yankees, was suspended for the 2014 baseball season after it was discovered that he used prohibited performance-enhancing drugs. In spite of the fact that Rodriguez denied the use of chemical compounds, he has been disgraced and his record remains under scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Photo of many bicycle riders in uniforms, riding on a street." height="675" src="images/file1.jpg" width="1200"/><div style="font-style: italic;">Cycling is a team sport that has been impacted by doping schemes.</div></p><p/><p/><p><span>Because steroids have been declared illegal and are now easily identifiable, athletes have started substituting new techniques to obtain unfair advantages that are even more challenging to detect. For example, cyclists and other endurance athletes administer blood transfusions to themselves in order to alter the oxygenation of their blood.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the cyclist Lance Armstrong finally acknowledged that he was using illegal techniques and substances to win his numerous titles and trophies, which had earned him enormous earnings and endorsement deals. Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times, but after compelling evidence surfaced of his use of clandestine compounds, the United States Anti-Doping Agency stripped him of his titles in 2012. The U.S. Postal Service is even suing Armstrong for fraud because the USPS had paid millions of dollars to subsidize Armstrong and his entire team. </span></p><p><span>Some commentators argue that athletes should not be blamed for partake in using illicit drugs and techniques to get a competitive advantage. Sports writers point out that athletes are so pressured to continuously perform and outdo competitors that steroid use is very tempting. If fans and sponsors didn’t push for more power hitting, faster times, and bigger championships, they argue, maybe athletes would be less inclined to alter their bodies with potentially dangerous drugs.</span></p><p><span>Many athletes are conflicted about using these chemical compounds, which take a toll on their mental and physical health. Those using steroids are conscious of the negative consequences; men’s breasts grow, and their testicles shrink, they may get acne, and many users experience delusions or feelings of belligerence, known as “roid rage.”</span></p><p><span>Some fundamental questions that perhaps should be asked are: Who is responsible for making illegal substances part of team sports? Would athletes alter their blood and body chemistry if they didn’t feel so much pressure to outperform their peers? Should fans and sponsors bear some of the responsibility?</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Credits:</span></em></p><ul><li><p><em><span>Text credit: <a href="https://serpinstitute.box.com/shared/static/bc6gzx3z6gr6icvqzsjj5hygc6d13kef.pdf" target="_blank">Word Generation by SERP</a> and licensed under a</span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</span></a><span> </span><span> </span></em></p></li><li><p><em><span>Image credit:</span><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=72088285"><span> </span></a><span> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=217796" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons </a></span><span><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=217796" target="_blank">By Vzach - Own work, Public Domain</a>. </span></em></p></li></ul>
