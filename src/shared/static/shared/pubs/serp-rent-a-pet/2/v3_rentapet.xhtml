  <body><h1>Do the Benefits of Renting a Pet Outweigh the Potential Harm it
  Can Cause the Animals?</h1> <p>Davonte Reese wanted a dog, but his parents
  didn’t think he was capable of taking care of one. Then they heard about a
  company that rents pets. Davonte’s parents were pleased that the pet rental
  company gave them the chance to rent a Dalmatian for a day. Renting a
  Dalmatian helped them realize that Davonte was ready to own a dog. As a
  result, Davonte’s parents took him to an animal shelter and adopted a
  mixed-breed dog named Lucky.</p> <aside class="annotation"><p><strong>Animal
  Shelters</strong></p><p>Animal shelters are community businesses that house
  and protect animals. Not only can people adopt pets from animal shelters,
  when you get a new pet, you can learn about how to care for your pet at
  animal shelters. In addition, you can learn about laws that protect animals
  or even discover laws that protect people who have neighbors with noisy
  pets!</p></aside> <figure><img alt="Photo of cat on a leash."

  when people rent them as pets? </figcaption></figure> <p>Some people say
  renting a dog should be prohibited. They believe rental businesses are
  harmful to dogs; to be happy, they say, a dog needs ongoing contact with one
  person. People who are against pet rentals give several other reasons to
  support their position. For example, a dog likes to know its home.</p>
  <p>Dogs and people transformed together, so dogs depend on their human
  “family.” They have some social skills that are similar to those of humans.
  People acculturated dogs to be socially compatible and live with humans.
  Therefore, people have a special responsibility to ascertain that dogs have
  stable homes. Dogs have a special right to a permanent home with ongoing
  affection and comradeship. Also, who will want rental dogs when they become
  sick, old, or infirm? </p><aside class="annotation"><p><strong>Domesticated
  Animals</strong></p><p>Originally, all animals were wild animals. People
  began to domesticate animals (or train them) as helpful workers and pets
  many thousands of years ago. Dogs were helpful for shepherding sheep,
  alerting people to danger and helping people keep warm. Dogs are descended
  from or come from wolves. Other animals that were domesticated include
  sheep, cats, and goats.</p></aside><p>Marlena Davis argues against the
  notion that pet rental has a negative impact on dogs. She has a pet rental
  business in which she buys mostly purebred dogs, and then rents them for $50
  or more a day. A dog in her pet rental business has the opportunity to spend
  time with a different family every day of the week. Whereas people who own
  dogs leave them home alone, Marlena says people who rent dogs give the
  animals a great deal of attention. Also, families like Davonte’s can use pet
  rentals to make an informed decision about whether owning a dog is right for
  them, or not. In addition, Marlena contests that her business also creates
  jobs for her community.</p><p>Some states may make it against the law to
  rent pets. If you were going to write to a member of your state assembly,
  what would you say? Should it be illegal to rent a
  pet?</p><hr /><p>Credits:</p><p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
