  <body><h1>Do the Benefits of Renting a Pet Outweigh the Potential Harm it
  Can Cause the Animals?</h1> <p>Davonte Reese wanted a dog. His parents
  didn’t think he was capable of taking care of one. Then they heard about a
  company that rents pets. Davonte’s parents were glad. The pet rental company
  gave them the chance to rent a Dalmatian for a day. Renting a Dalmatian
  helped them realize that Davonte was ready to own a dog. His parents then
  took Davonte to an animal shelter and adopted a mixed-breed dog named
  Lucky.</p><aside class="annotation"><p><strong>Animal
  Shelters</strong></p><p>Animal shelters are places that house and protect
  animals. People can adopt pets from animal shelters. When you get a new pet,
  you can learn about how to care for your pet at animal shelters. You can
  also learn about laws that protect animals. You can learn about laws that
  protect people who have neighbors with noisy pets!</p></aside><figure><img

  when people rent them as pets? </figcaption></figure> <p>Some people say
  renting a dog should be illegal. They believe rental businesses are harmful
  to dogs. To be happy, they say, a dog needs ongoing contact with one person.
  People who are against pet rentals give several other reasons to support
  their position. For example, a dog likes to know its home.</p> <p>Dogs and
  people developed together, so dogs depend on their human “family.” They have
  some social skills that are like those of humans. People tame dogs to be
  socially compatible and live with humans. Therefore, people have a special
  responsibility to guarantee dogs have stable homes. Dogs have a special
  right to a permanent home with ongoing friendship. Also, who will want
  rental dogs when they are sick or old?</p><aside
  class="annotation"><p><strong>Domesticated
  Animals</strong></p><p>Originally, all animals were wild. People began to
  tame them (or train them) as helpful pets many thousands of years ago. Dogs
  were helpful for gathering sheep. Dogs alerted people to danger. Dogs helped
  people keep warm. Dogs are descended from or come from wolves. Other animals
  that were domesticated include sheep, cats, and goats.</p></aside><p>Marlena
  Davis disagrees with the notion that pet rental is bad for dogs. She has a
  pet rental business. She buys mostly purebred dogs. She rents them for $50
  or more a day. A dog can spend time with a different family every day of the
  week. Whereas people who own dogs leave them home alone, Marlena says people
  who rent dogs give the animals lots of attention. Also, families like
  Davonte’s can use pet rentals to decide whether to own a dog or not.
  Marlena’s business also creates jobs.</p><p>Some states may make it against
  the law to rent pets. If you were going to write to a member of your state
  assembly, what would you say? Should it be illegal to rent a
  pet?</p><hr /><p>Credits:</p><p><i>Text credit:</i> <a
